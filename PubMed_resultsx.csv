41552932,Individualised total knee arthroplasty demonstrates 99.4% survival at 3 to 5 years.,"The purpose of this multicentre observational study is to evaluate implant survival and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at 3-5 years following individualised total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A consecutive series of 426 patients (434 knees) underwent CT-based, posterior-stabilised, cemented, individualised TKA between December 2018 and August 2020. After excluding 73 patients without informed consent, 353 patients (361 knees) were included for survival analysis. A further 74 were excluded (revised = 2, deceased = 11, inadequate follow-up = 61), resulting in a final cohort of 279 patients (287 knees) for PROMs assessment. Implant survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, with revision of any component for any reason as the endpoint at 2- and 3-year follow-ups. Patients completed pre and postoperative questionnaires of the Oxford knee score (OKS) and the forgotten joint score (FJS), and also rated their level of satisfaction on a 4-level Likert scale. The proportion of patients who achieved a patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) was estimated according to the threshold of 30 for OKS and 38 for FJS. Considering revision for any reason as endpoint, the survival according to the KM method was 99.4% (95%C.I. 98.6%-100.0%) at both 2- and 3-year follow-up. The OKS improved from 22.2 ± 8.4 to 40.6 ± 7.6, and 244 knees (85%) achieved the PASS. The FJS improved from 16.7 ± 14.6 to 68.5 ± 27.7, and 233 (81%) achieved the PASS. Out of the 254 knees with their rated level of satisfaction, 250 (98.4%) were either satisfied or very satisfied. At 3 to 5 years' follow-up, individualised TKA demonstrated excellent implant survival (99.4%), as well as high patient satisfaction, both considering and disregarding non-respondents (87.1% and 98.4% respectively). The results are promising and warrant continued follow-up to evaluate long-term results.

41541989,Acetabular Distraction and the Cup-in-Cup Technique for the Management of Pelvic Discontinuity: A Case Report.,"Periprosthetic pelvic discontinuity is a rare but challenging complication in revision total hip arthroplasty (THA), particularly in the setting of severe acetabular bone loss. Restoration of the hip center and limb length, along with achieving implant stability, are critical for successful outcomes. We present a 68-year-old male with recurrent dislocations and a chronic flexible periprosthetic pelvic discontinuity of the left hip, likely originating from an intraoperative fracture during a prior THA revision, classified as Paprosky IIIB and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) type IV. Imaging revealed a transverse fracture involving the iliopubic and ilioischial rami with significant bone loss. The patient underwent revision arthroplasty using acetabular distraction combined with a modular double-cup construct. A trabecular metal shell was used as a super-augment, and a smaller dual-mobility cup was cemented within the shell to restore the hip center, offset, and limb length. Postoperatively, the patient achieved stable fixation with restoration of limb length and hip biomechanics. Early functional outcomes were favorable, and radiographs demonstrated maintenance of the hip center without evidence of loosening. Acetabular distraction with a modular double-cup construct is an effective strategy for managing chronic flexible periprosthetic pelvic discontinuity with severe acetabular bone loss, providing immediate mechanical stability, restoring the hip center and offset, and offering a reproducible alternative to traditional reconstruction methods.","Ponce de Leon Sandoval Iturbide A, Soriano Solís Héctor A, Herce Santisteban Alejandro, Kerbel Sutton Jacobo, González Ugalde Humberto",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41541989/,"Orthopedics and Traumatology Center, American British Cowdray (ABC) Medical Center, Mexico City, MEX.; Hip and Knee Replacement, American British Cowdray (ABC) Medical Center, Mexico City, MEX."
41541961,The First Bilateral Staged Oxford Cementless Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty in Louisiana Following FDA Approval: A Case Report.,"We present the case of a 63-year-old woman with bilateral medial compartment osteoarthritis who underwent the first staged bilateral cementless Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (OUKA) performed in the state of Louisiana shortly after its FDA approval in 2024. The patient had a five-year history of progressively worsening knee pain refractory to conservative therapy, including corticosteroid injections and physical therapy. Imaging confirmed isolated medial compartment disease with preserved lateral compartments and intact cruciate ligaments. Following the right OUKA, she demonstrated rapid recovery, full extension, and near-complete resolution of pain within four weeks. Due to persistent pain in the contralateral knee, a left OUKA was performed six weeks later with similarly favorable results. Postoperative imaging confirmed appropriate prosthesis positioning bilaterally without evidence of loosening, migration, or malalignment. The patient resumed full ambulation and reported restoration of functional capacity. This case highlights the early postoperative benefits and potential long-term promise of cementless OUKA, including faster recovery, reduced surgical time, and avoidance of cement-related complications. The implant's titanium and hydroxyapatite coating may further enhance biological fixation and durability. As cementless technology gains traction in the United States, continued follow-up and longitudinal studies will be essential to confirm its long-term survivorship and clinical efficacy compared to traditional cemented designs.","Villar Nicholas M, Lee Grace, Vo Joseph, Cluney Cameron, Dennis Lee A, Dittmar Jenna",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41541961/,"Orthopedics, Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Monroe, USA.; Ophthalmology, Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Monroe, USA.; Emergency Medicine, Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Monroe, USA.; Medicine, Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Monroe, USA.; Anatomy, Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Monroe, USA."
41541461,A Step Beyond Convention: Three-Stage Revision with Limb Reconstruction System Fixator for Chronic Infected Total Knee Arthroplasty - A Case Report.,"Chronic periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a limb-threatening complication, especially in the presence of sinus tract formation, bone loss, and failed prior revisions. While two-stage revision remains the standard of care, its success is limited in complex infections. We present a single case of chronic infected TKA with a discharging sinus managed successfully using a three-stage revision protocol. The treatment involved implant removal and antibiotic-loaded cement spacer insertion, interim stabilization using a Limb Reconstruction System (LRS) external fixator, and definitive revision TKA. The three-stage revision strategy with interim LRS fixation achieved complete infection eradication, restoration of limb alignment, and satisfactory functional outcome. This approach represents a reliable salvage option in complex chronic PJI cases.","Purushothaman V, Kavilakshmanan R",Journal of orthopaedic case reports,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41541461/,"Department of Orthopaedics, Government Tirunelveli Medical College and Hospital, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India."
41537033,Fast-setting Bone Cement in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Case Series Looking at Safety and Short-term Radiological Outcomes.,"Fast-setting high viscosity cement was introduced in the last decade, offering arthroplasty surgeons the benefit of shortened setting time. This could reduce the operating time, which may reduce the risk of infection and improve theatre efficiency. PALACOS® Fast R+G high viscosity cement has an average setting time of less than 6 minutes (30% faster than regular PALACOS® R+G) due to the lack of a waiting phase. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of total knee arthroplasty performed using this fast-setting, high viscosity cement and short-term radiological outcomes. This single surgeon case series looked at 344 primary TKAs performed using PALACOS® fast R+G cement from January 2016 to March 2020. Data were collected on patient demographics, perioperative events, and complications. Radiographs taken immediately post-operatively and at the one-year follow-up were analysed using the Knee Society Roentgenographic Evaluation and Scoring System (KSRESS). This case series included 313 consecutive patients (31 bilateral) with a mean age of 70 years (range 44-93). A total of 237 patients (76%, 262 TKA patients) had a minimum one-year follow-up. No adverse events were noted perioperatively; ten patients had superficial wound issues and were managed successfully with wound care and/or oral antibiotics. Six (1.7%) patients underwent re-operation in the study period. These included one DAIR, one staged revision for deep infection, two revisions for instability, one manipulation under anaesthetic for stiffness, and one patella internal fixation for fracture. The mean combined valgus angle for the prosthesis was 183.1° (range 177.7° to 187.8°), indicating adequate alignment. At one-year follow-up, no radiographs demonstrated any new loosening or worsening of any previously noted radiolucent lines. This study reports the largest case series that looks at the use of fast-setting bone cement in primary TKA. It demonstrates good safety, as evidenced by a low re-operation rate, deep infection rate, and no adverse events during implantation. Fast-setting cement offers the promise of improving theatre efficiency and decreasing total running costs. Further studies are needed to provide data on improved theatre efficiency, cost savings and the longevity of implanted knees utilising this cement.","D'sa P, Mercer S, Ghosh S, Thomas B K, Atkinson L, Bajada S, Williams R",Malaysian orthopaedic journal,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41537033/,"Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Glangwili General Hospital (GGH), Carmarthen, United Kingdom."
41513075,Contemporary Outcomes of Highly Porous Metaphyseal Cones in Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Metaphyseal bone loss represents a major reconstructive challenge in revision total knee arthroplasty (RTKA). Highly porous metaphyseal cones have potential for osseointegration and durable fixation. While early evidence was limited to tantalum cones, newer designs, such as three-dimensional-printed titanium cones, have been introduced by multiple manufacturers, necessitating an updated synthesis of the literature. PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception through October 1, 2024. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials and observational cohorts reporting clinical or radiological outcomes of metaphyseal cones in RTKA with a minimum 1-year follow-up. Demographics, implant characteristics, functional scores, survivorship, cone removal rates, and radiographic outcomes were recorded. Pooled analyses were performed using random-effects models, with subgroup analyses by cone material and fixation type. There were 63 studies comprising 4,433 patients and 5,435 cones that were included, with 79.9% of femora and 75.4% of tibiae involving Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute Type 2B or 3 defects. Significant improvements in function were observed, with pooled Knee Society Score Knee and Function scores of 77.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.6 to 84.3) and 67.5 (95% CI, 58.4 to 76.6), respectively. The pooled all-cause re-revision rate at a weighted mean follow-up of 49.7 months was 13.5% (95% CI, 11.0 to 16.2%), most commonly due to infection, while cone removal occurred in 3.6% (95% CI, 2.2 to 5.2%), with aseptic loosening accounting for only 0.7%. Radiographic osseointegration was achieved in 96.0% (95% CI, 92.5 to 98.5%). Subgroup analyses demonstrated no significant difference in survivorship between tantalum versus titanium cones (3.7% versus 2.2%, P = 0.199), or cemented versus hybrid fixation (4.7 versus 1.9%, P = 0.274). Modern metaphyseal cones have high osseointegration rates and implant survivorship in RTKA. Failure due to aseptic loosening is exceedingly rare, with infection being the predominant cause of cone revision. These findings support metaphyseal cones as a reliable solution for managing severe bone loss in RTKA, with comparable outcomes noted across different cone materials and fixation strategies.","Goh Graham S, Lee Seungjun, Singh Kevin, Travers Hannah I, Kuznetsov Mikhail, Thomas Terence L, Smith Eric L",The Journal of arthroplasty,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41513075/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.

41513074,External Validation of a New Classification for Bone Loss in Failed Stemmed Prostheses after Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Evaluation and management of bone loss in revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) poses a demanding challenge. The rising number of knee revisions and re-revisions has led to increasing bone loss severity, and previous bone loss classification systems fail to provide adequate assessment of the diaphysis. The Scuderi Classification was recently introduced to better assess diaphyseal bone loss and underwent internal validation. The purpose of this study was to perform an external validation using preoperative radiographs of failed stemmed rTKA and describe the interobserver and intraobserver reliability. From our institutional database, 128 preoperative radiographs of failed rTKAs with stemmed prostheses awaiting re-revision were identified. There were 120 stemmed femoral prostheses (60 cemented, 60 hybrid fixation) and 120 stemmed tibial prostheses (60 cemented, 60 hybrid fixation) that were subject to analysis. There were two readers who had similar experience levels who scored the cases according to the Scuderi classification, and each reader performed two independent reads at least two weeks apart from the first read. The levels of interobserver and intraobserver reliability were determined by the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Strong ICC for both femur (total: 0.96) and tibia (total: 0.89) has been demonstrated among the graders. Intraobserver reliability of 0.86 (grader one) and 0.79 (grader two) for femur and 0.8 (grader one) and 0.71 (grader two) for tibia demonstrated satisfactory agreement. Absolute score congruency between the readers was 86.7% for the femur and 89.2% for the tibia, showing excellent grading reproducibility for this new classification. This study provided an external validation of this bone loss classification in revision prosthesis with strong to near-perfect interobserver and intraobserver reliability. Based on our reported results, we advocate the use of this intuitive grading scheme, which can facilitate bone loss evaluation and may provide a future foundation to assist with implant selection in these complex cases.","Herold Johannes M, Shin Jonggu, Song Young Dong, Nocon Allina A, Boettner Friedrich, Sculco Peter K",The Journal of arthroplasty,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41513074/,"Stavros Niarchos Foundation Complex Joint Reconstruction Center, Hospital For Special Surgery, New York, NY 10021, United States.

41482930,Migration in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty with the Persona Partial Knee: a cohort study of 26 patients using radiostereometry with 60 months of follow-up.," Migration is an early sign of loosening. We investigated the migration and stability of the cemented Persona Partial Knee (PPK, Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN, USA), for both the femoral and tibial component, and evaluated the clinical results at 5 years' follow-up.  In this prospective cohort study, primary cemented PPKs were implanted. Migration of the tibial and femoral component at 5 years postoperatively was calculated using model-based radiostereometric analysis (mRSA) in terms of translations and rotations. To evaluate the clinical results, a clinical examination was performed using the Knee Society Score (KSS), and PROMs (NRS pain, KOOS-PS, OKS, EQ-5D) were registered.  26 patients were included. At 5 years postoperatively, we found low migration of both the tibial and femoral component, namely a translation of < 0.21 mm and rotation of < 0.75° in all directions for both components. Compared with 2 years' follow-up, the tibial components showed an increased total translation and total rotation at 5 years. The femoral components showed stable migration compared with 2 years' follow-up. The KSS decreased between 2 and 5 years, while the PROMs remained stable between 2 and 5 years' follow-up.  The PPK showed low migration of both the tibial and femoral components at 5 years' follow-up. The femoral component was stable between 2 and 5 years, while the tibial component still migrated.","Pasma Jantsje H, Hesseling Brechtje, De Esch Nicole, Verburg Hennie, Niesten Dieu D, Mathijssen Nina M C",Acta orthopaedica,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Radiostereometric Analysis, Male, Female, Knee Prosthesis, Aged, Follow-Up Studies, Prospective Studies, Prosthesis Failure, Middle Aged, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Prosthesis Design, Knee Joint, Range of Motion, Articular",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41482930/,"Reinier Haga Orthopedisch Centrum, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands. j.pasma@rhoc.nl.; Reinier Haga Orthopedisch Centrum, Zoetermeer; Department of Orthopedics, Reinier de Graaf Hospital, Delft, The Netherlands."
41464794,Early Outcomes of Cruciate-Retaining Versus Posterior-Stabilized Total Knee Arthroplasty in Younger Patients: A Prospective Eastern European Cohort Study.,"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Cruciate-retaining (CR) and posterior-stabilized (PS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are both widely used in primary knee osteoarthritis (KOA), but evidence in younger patients remains limited. This study compared functional outcomes, pain, range of motion, quality of life, and psychological status between CR and PS implants in an Eastern European cohort. <b>Methods</b>: A prospective comparative cohort study was conducted in patients aged 40-64 years undergoing primary cemented TKA. The primary outcome was change in the Lower-Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale, EQ5D5L index, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, PROMIS Depression score, active knee flexion, and patient satisfaction. Outcomes were evaluated at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Between-group comparisons used Welch <i>t</i>-tests and results are reported as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. <b>Results</b>: A total of 147 patients were included (CR <i>n</i> = 71; PS <i>n</i> = 76). The prespecified primary endpoint, 12-month change in LEFS, was very similar between groups (mean difference 0.14 points, 95% CI -3.80 to 4.08; <i>p</i> = 0.94). LEFS improved from 49.1 ± 14.8 to 66.8 ± 11.6 in the CR group and from 47.9 ± 14.6 to 65.8 ± 12.4 in the PS group at 12 months. Lysholm scores increased to 88.5 ± 11.4 (CR) and 86.2 ± 10.6 (PS) (<i>p</i> = 0.21). EQ-5D-5L improved in both groups, with a non-significant difference at 12 months (<i>p</i> = 0.077). VAS pain decreased from 7.39 ± 1.19 to 1.59 ± 0.84 (CR) and from 7.55 ± 1.46 to 1.75 ± 0.90 (PS) (<i>p</i> = 0.27). Active flexion increased to 117.5 ± 10.5° (CR) and 115.0 ± 11.3° (PS) (<i>p</i> = 0.15). PROMIS Depression improved similarly in both groups, and satisfaction levels at 12 months were comparable. <b>Conclusions</b>: Both CR and PS TKA produced comparable improvements in pain, function, quality of life, mental health, and knee flexion in KOA patients aged 40-64 at one year. Implant design did not influence clinical benefit or PROMs in this cohort.","Vitalis Lorand, Feier Andrei Marian, Zuh Sandor György, Russu Octav Marius, Pop Tudor Sorin",Journal of clinical medicine,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41464794/,"Doctoral School, George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, and Technology of Targu Mures, 540142 Targu Mures, Romania.; Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Clinical County Hospital of Mureș, 540139 Targu Mures, Romania.; Department M4 Clinical Sciences, Orthopedics and Traumatology I, George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, and Technology of Targu Mures, 540139 Targu Mures, Romania."
41458181,Utilization of an Anteromedial Cortical Window for Tibial Component Removal During Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Revision total knee arthroplasty often entails removal of well-fixed components. Tibial component removal is particularly challenging due to (I) mechanical barriers that limit circumferential disruption when pegs, keels, or stems are present; (II) restricted access to implant-cement and cement-bone interfaces within the proximal canal; and (III) the proximity of critical structures, including the collateral ligaments, patellar tendon, popliteal artery, and distal femur. We present a novel anteromedial cortical window technique that facilitates removal of well-fixed tibial components by improving access to the implant-cement, burr-cement, and cement-bone interfaces within the proximal tibial metaphysis. This technique is suited for cases not requiring posterolateral exposure, offering a less morbid alternative to tibial tubercle osteotomy with the option for conversion if greater exposure is needed.","Ross Bailey J, Glassman Jacob, Nour Grayson, Wilson Jacob M, Rodriguez Jose A, Premkumar Ajay",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41458181/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.; College of Medicine, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; Adult Reconstruction and Joint Replacement Department, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA."

A retrospective cohort study of 1,289 patients who underwent primary cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from 2003 to 2022 was conducted. Mobile-bearing prostheses were used in 820 patients (mean follow-up: 8.1 years), and FB in 469 patients (mean follow-up: 15.2 years). Functional outcomes were assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Kujala scores. Range of motion and axial tibial rotation were clinically evaluated. Statistical tests included analysis of variance, <i>t</i> -tests, and Fisher's F-test (significance <i>p</i>  < 0.05). Both groups showed significant functional improvement ( <i>p</i>  < 0.001).

41405155,Similar tibial and femoral component fixation of mobile-bearing and fixed-bearing lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: A radiostereometry study with 5-year follow-up.,"To compare tibial and femoral component fixation of lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) with mobile-bearing (MB) and fixed-bearing (FB) designs up to 5 years follow-up. The primary outcome was mean tibial component maximal total point motion (MTPM) at 1-year follow-up. The Oxford lateral domed UKA (n = 14) and the Oxford Fixed Lateral UKA (n = 13) were inserted in 27 patients with posterolateral unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis. Tibial implants were cemented, while femoral implants were either cemented (n = 17) or cementless (n = 10). At baseline, 1-, 2-, and 5-year follow-up, radiostereometry (RSA) imaging, Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and EQ-5D-5L quality of life score were collected. A newly updated 1-year migration threshold was used to determine 15-year revision-risk with migration above 0.4 mm termed 'at-risk'. At 1-year follow-up, tibial implant MTPM was 0.47 mm (confidence interval [CI]: 0.32; 0.62) for MB UKA and 0.52 mm (CI: 0.36; 0.68) for FB UKA. Femoral implant MTPM was 0.56 mm (CI: 0.34; 0.79) for MB UKA and 0.54 mm (CI: 0.30; 0.77) for FB UKA. Migration patterns were similar between cemented and cementless femoral components. No differences in tibial implant MTPM were found between groups at follow-up, with a mean difference of -0.06 (CI: -0.28; 0.15) at 2-year and -0.06 (CI: -0.31; 0.18) at 5-year follow-up. Further, 16/25 (MB: 7/13, FB: 9/12) implants were in the ""at-risk"" group for 15-year revision. Both groups demonstrated clinically relevant improvements in OKS and European quality of life score (EQ-5D-5L), no differences between FB and MB were found. The MB and FB tibial components had similar good fixation and clinical improvement until 5 years of follow-up. MTPM migration for both tibial groups was in the 'at risk' group for revision based on the newly established 1-year migration threshold, but showed no measurable migration after the 1-year follow-up.

In this prospective randomized controlled trial, 141 Han Chinese (East Asian) patients (mean age, 68.3 years; 85% female) were allocated to 1 of 3 groups: tourniquet (Group A), no tourniquet (Group B), and tourniquet during cementation only (Group C). The primary outcomes were 3D cement penetration (thickness, volume, surface area) and mid-term implant stability assessed on the basis of radiolucent lines (RLLs) and survivorship. Cement penetration metrics across femoral and tibial components were systematically quantified through 3D morphological analysis of metal artifact reduction-computed tomography (MAR-CT) images reconstructed using Avizo software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Secondary outcomes included blood loss, inflammatory and muscle-injury biomarkers, pain scores, functional scores, postoperative length of stay, and complication rates. All participants were followed for 5 years. No significant intergroup differences in cement penetration (thickness, volume, surface area) around the tibial (p = 0.847, p = 0.473, and p = 0.395, respectively) and femoral (p = 0.203, 0.201, 0.399) components were observed. Cement thickness correlated with preoperative knee deformity but not with implant size. Additionally, Group B demonstrated superior clinical outcomes versus Groups A and C: lower levels of inflammatory and muscle-injury biomarkers, lower early pain scores, and a shorter hospital stay, with enhanced 3-month knee function demonstrated in Groups B and C versus Group A. Total blood loss, mid-term outcomes, and complication rates were comparable. No RLLs or revisions were observed, and the 5-year implant survival rate was 100%. Tourniquet use showed no significant effect on cement penetration and mid-term implant stability in primary TKA, and omitting intraoperative tourniquet use was associated with better early postoperative functional recovery in patients undergoing TKA.

41356551,Cementless Versus Cemented Fixation in Total Knee Arthroplasty: Analysis of Regional Tibial Bone Density and Clinical Outcome.,"Cementless fixation in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has theoretical advantages of being biological and bone preserving, but some surgeons are less confident in using it given previous reports of high failure rates in some implant designs. This study aimed to investigate the effect of fixation method on tibial bone density, clinical outcome, and survivorship. The main research question was whether fixation method would affect the postoperative change in tibial bone density in TKA. This study analyzed 53 cementless TKAs and 53 cemented TKAs of the same brand (Triathlon, Stryker). Digital radiological densitometry (DRD) was used to quantify the changes in regional tibial bone density (RTBD) within the first 2 years. Clinical outcome scores and survivorship were recorded. Significant decreases in RTBD were observed in both groups in all tibial regions (<i>p</i> < 0.001 at all time points). RTBD was significantly higher in 7 of 8 tibial regions in cementless TKA at 6 months. The significance persisted in 2 regions of the lateral tibial condyle until the second year (<i>p</i> = 0.014 and <i>p</i> = 0.029). Clinical outcome scores (Knee Society Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and Forgotten Joint Score) were similar. No case of aseptic loosening was reported. Proximal tibial bone resorption was common in both cementless and cemented TKAs. Cementless fixation preserved more tibial metaphyseal bone globally at 6 months and at the lateral tibial condyle at 24 months. Its early clinical outcomes and survivorship were comparable to those of cemented fixation.","Wong Daniel Wai-Yip, Lee Qunn-Jid, Lo Chi-Kin, Law Kenneth Wing-Kin, Chang Esther Wai-Yee, Wong Yiu-Chung",Clinics in orthopedic surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Female, Male, Aged, Tibia, Bone Density, Middle Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Bone Cements, Treatment Outcome, Aged, 80 and over, Cementation, Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41356551/,"Total Joint Replacement Centre, Yan Chai Hospital, Hong Kong, China."

While periprosthetic bone loss links to loosening in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA), this association and post-UKA periprosthetic Bone Mineral Density (BMD) changes are understudied. Systematically exploring dynamic post-UKA BMD changes is vital for optimizing management and reducing loosening risk.​. This prospective study included 40 patients (40 knees) with knee AMOA who underwent UKA (January 2020-January 2024). All received cemented Oxford unicompartmental prostheses implanted by the same surgeon (standard technique). Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) measured periprosthetic BMD preoperatively, and at one, three, six and 12 months postoperatively to analyze change patterns.​. Periprosthetic BMD decreased rapidly at one and three months postoperatively, then increased at six and 12 months (p < 0.05). No significant differences were noted in tibial prosthesis BMD changes (ROI 1, ROI 2) or femoral prosthesis stem posterior BMD values (ROI 4) between six and 12 months (p > 0.05).​.

41314404,National Trends in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty During a Period of Major Survivorship Improvements: Insights From the Dutch Arthroplasty Register.,"The rising use of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) among various Western countries raises questions regarding the multifaceted determinants driving this trend. Therefore, this study aimed to examine trends and their associations with 3-year survivorship, focusing on patient, implant, hospital, and revision-related factors. All primary medial UKAs for osteoarthritis registered in the Dutch Arthroplasty Register from 2014 to 2021 were included. Age, sex, BMI, prior ipsilateral knee surgery, implant type (cemented and uncemented mobile-bearing; cemented fixed-bearing), hospital practice (annual volume and usage), reasons for revision, and revision type were analyzed across four consecutive 2-year intervals. The 3-year survivorship was evaluated, and factors associated with revision risk were identified across these intervals. A total of 27,234 medial UKAs were analyzed, revealing an increased patient age, a higher proportion of men, and fewer prior ipsilateral knee surgeries over time (P < 0.001). A profound increase occurred in uncemented mobile-bearing use and high-volume and usage hospitals (P < 0.001). The 3-year survivorship increased from 93.9 to 96.2% (P < 0.001). Higher hospital volume and usage, older patient age, and fewer prior ipsilateral knee surgeries were associated with reduced 3-year revision risk (P < 0.001) across various time intervals; body mass index and sex were not (P > 0.05). The reasons for revision shifted over time, with increases in infection, pain, and periprosthetic fractures, while femoral loosening decreased (P < 0.001). Although most revisions were conversions to total knee arthroplasty, this decreased as bearing exchanges became more common (P < 0.001). This nationwide registry study demonstrated significant changes in patient, implant, and hospital factors for medial UKA, alongside improved 3-year survivorship. Associations between these factors and revision risk suggest these changes may have contributed to better survivorship. Changing patterns in revision reasons and types reflect evolving challenges in UKA management. These findings provide evidence to inform strategies for improving survivorship and understanding revision patterns in medial UKA.","Burger Joost A, Vossen Roderick J M, Bayoumi Tarik, Sierevelt Inger N, Ten Noever de Brauw Gaby V, Spekenbrink-Spooren Anneke, Zuiderbaan Hendrik A",The Journal of arthroplasty,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41314404/,"Center for Musculoskeletal Surgery, Charité Universitätsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, Amsterdam UMC Location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, Medische Kliniek Velsen, Velsen-Noord, The Netherlands.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, Amsterdam UMC Location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Department of general surgery, Tergooi MC, Hilversum, The Netherlands.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, Amsterdam UMC Location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Spaarne Gasthuis Academy, Orthopedic Department, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands; Xpert Orthopedics, Orthopedic Department, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Dutch Arthroplasty Register (LROI), 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, Medische Kliniek Velsen, Velsen-Noord, The Netherlands."

41246576,A Prospective Multicenter Analysis of the Mid-term Outcomes of Component Size Variation in Simultaneous Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty: Does One-Size Difference Matter?,"Background In simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (bTKA), surgeons often encounter scenarios where femoral or tibial component sizes differ between limbs. While component sizing is routinely individualized, the functional and survivorship implications of such asymmetry remain insufficiently studied. A clearer understanding is clinically relevant, as patient anatomy, bone stock, and soft-tissue balance often necessitate asymmetric sizing, yet evidence guiding its safety and outcomes is limited. This prospective multicenter study evaluated whether inter-limb differences in component sizing influence postoperative function, patient-reported outcomes, or revision risk in bTKA. Methods Patients undergoing cemented bTKA with standardized implants (metal femoral components, metal-backed tibial baseplates, and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene inserts) were prospectively enrolled across 10 high-volume centers. Patients were stratified into Subset A (identical component sizes in both knees) and Subset B (different component sizes between knees). Clinical and functional outcomes were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively at regular intervals up to three years. Endpoints included range of motion (ROM), Knee Society Score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Radiographic assessment evaluated alignment, fixation, and implant stability. Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds were used to confirm the clinical relevance of improvements. Results A total of 166 patients (332 knees) were analyzed, with 140 in Subset A and 26 in Subset B. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. Both subsets demonstrated significant improvements in ROM and functional scores from baseline to three years (p<0.001 for within-group changes). Subset A achieved higher final ROM (123.6° vs. 118.1°; p<0.001) with less variability, and KSS were also significantly greater in this group (p<0.05). Subset B, despite inter-knee size differences, showed improvements similar to Subset A in WOMAC scores and demonstrated higher values in selected SF-36 domains, including physical functioning, role limitations, and emotional well-being (p<0.05). No implant-related complications, revisions, or radiographic failures were reported in either group during the three-year follow-up, and radiographs confirmed stable and well-aligned prostheses. Conclusion A one-size difference in femoral or tibial components between knees does not compromise clinical or functional outcomes in bTKA. While symmetric sizing may provide slightly greater ROM and KSS improvements, minor asymmetry is not detrimental and may even be associated with enhanced patient-reported quality-of-life domains. These findings support the practice of individualized component selection and reassure surgeons that small inter-limb differences in implant sizing do not negatively impact mid-term function or survivorship.","Bhalodiya Haresh P, Singh Rakesh Kumar, Logani Vivek, Makwana Vivdh, Oberoi Ips, Solanki Devendra S, Wakankar Hemant, Singh Avtar K, Chatterjee Buddhadev, Mahajan Sanjeev, Yadav Chandrashekhar, Thakkar Ashokkumar, Chandra Udita, Aneja Kunal, Bajwa Supreet, Machaiah Ponnanna, Rudraraju Ravi Teja, Singh Dolly",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41246576/,"Orthopaedics, Saviour Hospital, Ahmedabad, IND.; Orthopaedics, Global Hospital for Joint Replacement, Kanpur, IND.; Joint Replacement and Sports Injury, Paras Hospital, Gurugram, IND.; Orthopaedics, Navneet Hi-Tech Hospital, Mumbai, IND.; Orthopaedics, Artemis Health Institute, Gurugram, IND.; Orthopaedics, Artemis Hospitals, Gurgaon, IND.; Orthopaedics, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital and Research Center, Pune, IND.; Orthopaedics, Amandeep Hospital, Amritsar, IND.; Orthopaedics, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, IND.; Orthopaedics, Fortis Hospital, Ludhiana, IND.; Joint Replacement Surgery, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, IND.; Clinical Research and Medical Writing, Meril Life Sciences Pvt.

Ninety-four patients (106 knees) underwent cemented BCR-TKA with JIIXR at eight centers. The primary endpoint was 2-year survivorship tested for noninferiority versus a 98% benchmark using exact binomial (one-sided 97.5% CI) and Kaplan-Meier methods. Secondary endpoints included the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, its visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS), Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12, collected postoperatively only), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), range of motion, and radiolucent lines assessed in standardized zones. At 2 years, survivorship was 97.9% (94/96), confirming non-inferiority (<i>p</i> = 0.0064). Patient-reported outcome measures improved over follow-up: EQ-VAS increased from 62.0 preoperatively to 83.7 at 2 years; EQ-5D-5L index from 0.61 to 0.84; and KOOS pain and symptoms from 52.8 and 59.2 to 87.9 and 84.6, respectively. FJS-12 increased from 40.0 at 3 months to 65.4 at 2 years. Across measures, the changes exceeded published minimally clinically important differences (MCIDs): all KOOS subscales met MCID by 1 year, EQ-VAS exceeded MCID by 3 months, and FJS-12 exceeded MCID between 3 months and 1 year. Radiolucent lines were observed in 35 knees (36.5%); total length decreased from 5.1 ± 6.7 mm at 3 months to 2.6 ± 2.3 mm at 2 years with no radiographic loosening. Range of motion at 2 years was similar to baseline. In this prospective single-arm multicenter study, an anatomical-design BCR-TKA implant achieved good 2-year survivorship and clinically meaningful improvements in patient-reported outcomes, with stable radiographic findings.

41232093,More Short Term Pain in Noncemented Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Matched Cohort Analysis.,"Despite the resurgence of noncemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) following implant advancements in recent years, instances of greater postoperative pain remain a common finding compared with TKAs with cemented fixation. Newer noncemented designs have become appealing to younger, heavier, and active patients, with appropriate bone stock. A matched cohort analysis of patients undergoing primary, unilateral cemented and noncemented TKAs at a high-volume, orthopaedic specialty hospital. Enrolled patients had their index procedure between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2023. The initial cohort was 4,275 patients, with 455 noncemented and 3,820 cemented TKA patients. Patients were matched 1:1, with MAKO instrumentation and sex being matched exactly, while age was matched within 2 years, yielding 229 patients per group. Patient-reported outcomes were completed preoperatively, at 12 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. Forgotten Joint scores were assessed at 1 year. Patients' reported pain levels during their inpatient stay were higher in noncemented TKA patients, with pain values of 3.1 (±1.5) versus 3.2 (±1.7) at rest (P = 0.397) and 4.4 (±1.6) versus 4.8 (±1.8) with activity (P = 0.031). Morphine Milligram Equivalents were 26 points higher in the noncemented group (101.4 vs. 75.0, P < 0.001). Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores for Joint Replacement were similar between cohorts at all time points, when adjusted for preoperative differences. Forgotten joint scores were significantly different with the noncemented group scoring lower (56.6 [±28.2] vs. 44.3 [±31.7], P = 0.013) and fewer patients met the threshold for forgetting their joint (75.3% vs. 51%, P = 0.002). Complications and readmissions were similar between groups. This study concludes that noncemented TKA patients experience greater early postoperative pain and are more likely to be aware of their prosthesis than cemented TKA patients. Morphine Milligram Equivalent utilization for noncemented TKA patients was also markedly higher. Future studies should examine how to best define success for noncemented TKAs.","Hurdle Edmund, Strecker Sara, Nagarkatti Durgesh, Shekhman Mark, Goldberg Leah, Carangelo Robert James, Witmer Dan",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41232093/,"From the Bone and Joint Institute, Hartford Hospital, Hartford, CT (Hurdle, Strecker, Nagarkatti, Shekhman, Goldberg, Carangelo, and Witmer), and the Orthopedic Associates of Hartford, Hartford, CT (Nagarkatti, Shekhman, Carangelo, and Witmer)."
41227285,Cementless vs. Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty: Reduced Operative Time with Comparable Perioperative Safety-A Retrospective Cohort from a Tertiary Care Center.,"<b>Background:</b> Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a widely performed and highly successful procedure, with cemented fixation historically considered the standard. Advances in implant design have renewed interest in cementless fixation, which shows comparable survivorship and increasing use, particularly in younger patients. Evidence on perioperative outcomes remains mixed, prompting this study to compare hemoglobin decline and operative time between cemented and cementless TKA of the same design. <b>Methods:</b> This monocentric retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients undergoing primary TKA between 2019 and 2021, divided into cemented and cementless groups. Inclusion criteria were primary osteoarthritis, age > 45 years, hemoglobin > 13 g/dL, ferritin > 100 ng/mL, and complete perioperative hemoglobin data (preoperative, PostOperativeDay (POD)1, 3, 5). Primary outcomes were operative time and hemoglobin trajectory, analyzed using multivariable regression and mixed-effects models adjusted for age, sex, and implant design. Propensity score matching was performed as a sensitivity analysis. <b>Results:</b> A total of 123 TKAs were analyzed (63 cementless, 60 cemented). Cementless TKA had a shorter operative time than cemented (72.0 ± 12.0 vs. 79.8 ± 15.1 min; 95% CI -12.2 to -2.8; <i>p</i> < 0.01). Cementless fixation was associated with significantly shorter operative time (72.0 ± 11.8 vs. 79.8 ± 15.1 min, <i>p</i> < 0.01), a difference that remained significant after multivariable adjustment and propensity score matching. Postoperative hemoglobin declined in both groups, with no significant unadjusted between-group differences at any timepoint. In adjusted mixed-effects models, cementless TKA was associated with a slightly greater hemoglobin decline compared with cemented TKA, with mean adjusted differences of -0.56 g/dL on POD1 (95% CI [-0.95, -0.17]), -0.53 g/dL on POD3 (95% CI [-0.91, -0.14]), and -0.34 g/dL on POD5 (95% CI [-0.64, -0.04]). However, this was not clinically relevant, as no transfusions or anemia-related complications occurred. <b>Conclusions:</b> Cementless TKA was associated with reduced operative time compared with cemented fixation, an effect robust to adjustment and propensity score matching. These conclusions apply to a selected, relatively non-anemic cohort. Although hemoglobin decline was slightly greater with cementless fixation, the difference was small and not clinically meaningful.","Basso Marco, Anzillotti Giuseppe, Ruosi Luca, Kon Elizaveta, Minelli Marco, Arnaldi Enrico",Journal of clinical medicine,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41227285/,"IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Via Manzoni 56, 20089 Rozzano, Milan, Italy.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Via Rita Levi Montalcini 4, 20072 Pieve Emanuele, Milan, Italy."

41221074,Utilizing Femoral Metaphyseal Sleeves in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty for Post-Traumatic Osteoarthritis: A Case Report.,"Total knee arthroplasty in younger patients presents a heightened risk of postoperative complications and implant failures compared to older populations, particularly in those with posttraumatic arthritis. These challenges necessitate careful consideration and specialized approaches to optimize the outcomes in this patient demographic. A 43-year-old man presented with left knee pain resulting from a traumatic lawn mower injury, causing an intraarticular distal femur, at the age of 6. The injury led to a limb-length discrepancy for which he underwent 2 limb-lengthening procedures in his early 20s. Radiographs demonstrated advanced posttraumatic osteoarthritis, and the patient elected to proceed with surgical intervention. Intraoperatively, significant deficiencies of the medial femur and anterodistal femur were noted, making cement, a bone graft, or a combination of both, less viable options. He underwent a left total knee arthroplasty, with the utilization of a femoral metaphyseal sleeve, due to severe bone loss in the distal femur. Postoperatively, the patient progressed well and returned to his activities of daily living, and, at about 3 months, had a pain-free left knee, without a disturbance of his prior limb-length discrepancy. This is a rare case of a metaphyseal sleeve being used in a younger patient, revealing the potential for this procedure to be used in cases of primary total knee arthroplasty in patients with posttraumatic osteoarthritis.","Sukin Zachary, Dentinger Adam, Earl Jeremiah",HCA healthcare journal of medicine,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41221074/,"HCA Florida Trinity Hospital, Trinity, Florida."
41220454,"A Comprehensive Review of Operative Considerations, Surgical Techniques, Outcomes, and Future Perspectives in Total Knee Arthroplasty.","Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is still the gold-standard operative procedure for treating end-stage knee osteoarthritis, a disease impacting millions of patients worldwide and a key contributor to disability. As prevalence rates rise, the number of TKA procedures continues to increase. This review covers surgical procedure history, implant choices, perioperative guidelines, and technologies shaping TKA's future. We performed a comprehensive narrative review of published literature on several aspects of TKA. Significant areas of comparison include cemented versus cementless fixation, mobile versus fixed bearing, posterior-stabilized versus ultra-congruent design, and single-radius versus multi-radius femoral design. The review encompasses preoperative optimization, alignment methods, robotic and sensor-aided surgery, postoperative rehabilitation, and outcomes. The data were collected from peer-reviewed journals, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, and systematic reviews. Cemented TKA remains the norm, but a cementless approach has equivalent outcomes in younger patients. Subtle functional benefits may exist with mobile-bearing designs, and newer designs, such as medial pivot implants, aim at optimizing kinematics. Robotic and sensor systems enhance implant accuracy and soft-tissue balance, providing short-term benefits such as improved function, reduced errors, and decreased blood loss. However, long-term outcomes, including implant durability and sustained function, remain uncertain. Optimizing the preoperative state and providing patient education have a significant impact on the postoperative state, and an early functional advantage is often associated with minimally invasive approaches. Several upcoming advancements, like AI-assisted surgery, outpatient arthroplasty, and 3D patient-specific printed implants, could positively influence the planning and execution of TKA. Nonetheless, their broad adoption is hindered by high costs, limited accessibility, and the requirement for additional validation via extensive, long-term studies. These evidence gaps need to be filled before such technologies can be seamlessly incorporated into standard clinical routines.

41210906,"A Comparison of Revision Rates for Cemented Versus Cementless Fixation for a Single Prosthesis Posterior-Stabilized Total Knee Arthroplasty: Medium-Term Follow-up of Cases from the UK National Joint Registry, and Radiographic Analysis of a Northern Ireland Cohort.","Cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) offers several conceptual benefits over cemented TKA. However, the effect of the cam-post interaction of posterior-stabilized (PS)-TKA on implant osseointegration remains uncertain. Data were obtained from the UK National Joint Registry (UK NJR), on patients who underwent primary PS-TKA for osteoarthritis using the Stryker Triathlon system between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019. Patients were excluded if they had an implausible body mass index (BMI) or where there was use of bone graft, revision implants, or hybrid cementation. A local cohort of patients were similarly identified, with additional postoperative radiographic analysis performed. The primary outcome for both cohorts was all-cause survivorship. There were 18,824 relevant PS-TKA: 1,068 (5.7%) cementless and 17,756 (94.3%) cemented. The cementless group had a higher proportion of men (48.7% vs. 41.9%), a lower median age (70 vs. 71 years), a higher median BMI (31 vs. 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and shorter median duration of exposure to risk of revision (5.5 vs. 6.9 years, p < 0.01). All-cause revision rates were similar between the cementless and cemented groups (2.4% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.49). The second cohort of 875 patients had no statistical difference in all-cause revision rates for cementless and cemented PS-TKA (2.9% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.22), and radiographic analysis of those with cementless implants revealed that revision was more likely if there was radiographic loosening within the first 30 months postoperatively (33.3% vs. 2.1% if absent). This study, the largest of its kind, reports equivalent revision rates between cementless and cemented fixation of PS-TKA in the medium term, suggesting that either fixation option was reasonable for PS-TKA. This work complements existing NJR reports by providing a comparison not readily available, for the PS design of what is currently the most used TKA system in the United Kingdom. Level III.

41185794,Perioperative Blood Loss in Cementless Versus Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty With Local Tranexamic Acid Administration.,"Cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has historically been associated with greater perioperative blood loss than cemented TKA. Whether a standardized local-only tranexamic acid (TXA) regimen can mitigate this difference remains unclear. To compare perioperative blood loss between cementless and cemented TKA under a standardized local-only TXA protocol in a retrospective cohort, focusing on comparison rather than causation. Secondary outcomes included perioperative hemoglobin (Hb)/hematocrit (Hct) changes (preoperative to postoperative day (POD) 1), intraoperative and perioperative blood loss, transfusion, POD 7 D-dimer, operative time, and complications. We retrospectively reviewed 103 consecutive unilateral primary TKAs performed at a single center (cementless, n=55; cemented, n=48) between 2013 and 2020. A standardized local TXA protocol was used in all cases (1 g periarticular before implantation and 1 g intra-articular before closure); no drains were used. Outcomes included operative time, perioperative Hb/Hct change, intraoperative blood loss, total perioperative blood loss estimated by the Gross formula, transfusion, complications, and POD 7 D-dimer. Group comparisons used t-tests with Welch's correction or Mann-Whitney U tests, and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Baseline demographics were comparable between groups. Intraoperative blood loss was similar (cementless 91.4 ± 75.1 mL vs cemented 85.5 ± 111.2 mL; p=0.140), as was perioperative blood loss (154.3 ± 76.9 mL vs 132.9 ± 91.0 mL; p=0.204). No patient required transfusion. POD 7 D-dimer was higher in the cementless group (9.7±4.1 µg/mL vs 7.8±4.4 µg/mL; p=0.002), but no symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurred. Two late surgical-site infections in the cementless group resolved without revision or loosening; no wound complications occurred in either group. Under a standardized local-only TXA protocol, cementless TKA achieved perioperative blood loss comparable to cemented TKA without increasing symptomatic thromboembolic events. These findings suggest the feasibility of a standardized local TXA protocol for cementless TKA. Importantly, fixation method was fully collinear with implant design (cementless: low contact stress (LCS) limited-box; cemented: posterior-stabilized (PS) open-box), and femoral box geometry can influence bleeding; therefore, results should be interpreted within this implant- and protocol-specific context.","Ishimaru Daichi, Terabayashi Nobuo, Sohmiya Kazuki, Matsumoto Kazu",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41185794/,"Orthopaedic Surgery, Gifu Seiryu Hospital, Gifu, JPN.; Orthopedics, Gifu Seiryu Hospital, Gifu, JPN."
41164320,High coronal alignment accuracy and satisfactory early outcomes using augmented reality assisted kinematic alignment in total knee arthroplasty.,"Accurate component positioning in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is critical for implant longevity and patient satisfaction. Augmented reality (AR)-based navigation systems offer enhanced precision and intraoperative versatility. This study evaluated the accuracy of component positioning, implant sizing and short-term clinical outcomes of a novel AR-assisted navigation system (NextAR, Medacta International) in TKA using a modified kinematic alignment (KA) technique. Forty-one consecutive patients underwent primary TKA using AR-assisted navigation with ≥12-month follow-up. Preoperative CT-based 3D planning optimised cut orientation and component placement. All received a cemented medial pivot prosthesis (GMK Sphere) with full femoral resurfacing following a KA protocol. Tibial cuts were guided intraoperatively by real-time ligament balancing. Planned versus achieved positions were compared on radiographs. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), forgotten joint score (FJS) and range of motion (ROM) were recorded pre- and postoperatively and analysed using paired <i>t</i>-tests (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The average difference between planned and postoperative alignment was 0.05° ± 0.76° for LDFA, 0.1° ± 0.6° for MPTA, -0.5 ± 1.7° for femoral component flexion, and 0.3° ± 1.3° for PTS. Root mean square errors were 0.75°, 1.23°, 1.73° and 1.34°, respectively. Postoperative HKA improved from 174.3° ± 3.4° to 177.8° ± 2.1° (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Component size prediction was accurate in 100% of femurs and 95.1% of tibias. At final follow-up (14.2 ± 2.3 months), WOMAC improved from 51.5 ± 16.7 to 13.6 ± 5.3, FJS from 26.2 ± 9.6 to 82.2 ± 7.4, flexion from 103.3° ± 17.4° to 129.4° ± 7.2° and extension from 3.3° ± 0.43° to 0.1° ± 0.28° (all <i>p</i> < 0.001). AR-based navigation in modified KA-TKA ensured accurate LDFA restoration and femoral sizing, with good short-term outcomes. Variability remained in MPTA, femoral flexion and PTS. Although no coronal recuts were needed, two tibial recuts for tight extension gaps highlight areas for system refinement.

41161509,Outcomes and Implant Survival in Lateral Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: The Path Less Traveled.,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an effective treatment for isolated lateral compartment osteoarthritis (OA). Surgeons have been reticent to adopt this procedure due to the difficulty of exposure and historically higher rates of revision when compared to total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate our series of lateral UKAs. We retrospectively reviewed 548 fixed-bearing, cemented lateral UKAs performed at a single institution between January 2001 and May 2023. The diagnosis was OA in 98.5% of cases, and 71% of patients were women. The average age and body mass index at the time of surgery were 67 years (range, 28 to 93) and 27.8 (range, 18.0 to 49.5), respectively. The primary outcomes included implant survivorship and revision rate with associated causes. The secondary outcomes included complication rates and analysis of preoperative and postoperative tibio-femoral angle. The 10-years survivorship was 95.7%. There were 19 cases (3.5%) that required revision after a mean time in situ of 6.5 years, most commonly due to progression of OA (n = 14), followed by aseptic loosening (n = three), periprosthetic fracture (n = one), and infection (n = one). An additional 11 cases (2.0%) required reoperation without revision. The early (≤ 90 days) complication rate was 2.2%. Postoperative limb alignment did not differ significantly between revised and non-revised cases. In nonrevised patients, mean preoperative and postoperative tibio-femoral angle was 9.8 and 5.3° valgus, respectively. Patients revised for OA progression had similar alignment (preoperative 11.6°, P = 0.15; postoperative 5.3°, P = 0.94). Lateral UKA demonstrated excellent 10-years survivorship and a low complication rate. Most revisions were due to the progression of arthritis, which occurred independently of postoperative alignment. These findings support lateral UKA as a durable, joint-preserving option for appropriately selected patients.","Nwankwo Tobenna N, Li Katherine K, Parks Nancy L, Fricka Kevin B",The Journal of arthroplasty,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41161509/,"Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute, Alexandria, Virginia."
41147930,Uncemented Oxford mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty demonstrates superior long-term implant survival compared to cemented fixation in patients under 60 years.,"More patients are undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) at a younger age, and uncemented fixation has been introduced relatively recently. This study aimed to assess the effect of age and fixation type on outcomes following Oxford medial UKA. This retrospective multicentre study compared survivorship, revision indications and Oxford knee score (OKS) between cemented and uncemented mobile-bearing UKAs across three age groups (<60, 60-69 and ≥70 years). A total of 1401 primary medial Oxford UKAs were included, with mean follow-up of 7.2 ± 3.6 years. Overall, implant survivorship was 93.9%. For patients <60 years, revision-free implant survivorship was higher with uncemented versus cemented fixation 10 years: (91.0% vs. 81.8%, p = 0.014) and 15 years (88.2% vs. 78.8%, p = 0.02). The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) indicated an approximately threefold higher revision risk with cemented implants (HR 2.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-7.11; p = 0.02). There was no difference in revision-free implant survivorship in older patients (60-69 years: 10-years: 94.8% vs. 91.6%, p = 0.131; 15 years: 91.7% vs. 80.6%, HR: 1.98, 95% CI: 0.91-4.31, p = 0.087; ≥70 years: 10 years: 93.4% vs. 95.6%, p = 0.446; 15 years: 91.6% vs. 91.6%, HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.37-1.90, p = 0.67). Bearing dislocation was the most common reason for revision in uncemented implants among younger patients (50.0% and 40.0% of all revisions, respectively), whereas for the cemented group it was osteoarthritis progression (41.7% and 50.0%, respectively). OKS did not differ by fixation type, except for a small early advantage in the 60-69 group at 6 months (38.5 ± 8.1 vs. 40.5 ± 7.2; p = 0.03). Uncemented mobile-bearing Oxford UKA had superior long-term survivorship in patients <60 years of age. There was no difference for patients ≥60 years. These findings suggest that uncemented UKA should be considered for patients <60 years, whereas either cemented or uncemented UKA is suitable for patients >60 years.

41138995,Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty for Isolated Compartment Osteonecrosis: A 20-Year Experience.,"Osteonecrosis of the knee, whether primary (spontaneous) or secondary, can often necessitate surgical intervention. If advanced osteonecrosis is confined to a single compartment, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is often considered. The purpose of this study was to update and extend our prior series, with specific emphasis on implant survivorship, radiographic results, clinical outcomes, and complications in a concise cohort of UKAs for osteonecrosis. We retrospectively identified 70 consecutive UKAs for osteonecrosis performed at a single tertiary care academic institution from 2002 to 2022. Of these, 64 UKAs (91%) were performed for primary osteonecrosis, and six UKAs (9%) were performed for secondary osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis was in the medial femoral condyle in 61 UKAs (87%), medial tibial plateau in six UKAs (9%), and lateral femoral condyle in three UKAs (4%). All UKAs were cemented, with 77% utilizing a fixed-bearing design and 23% utilizing a mobile-bearing design. The mean patient age was 66 years, with 59% being women. The mean follow-up was eight years (range, two to 20). The 10-year survivorship free of any revision for the entire cohort was 91%. The predominant indication for revision was the development of osteoarthritis in the lateral compartment in three knees. The 10-year survivorship free of any reoperation was 88%. The secondary osteonecrosis was a significant and substantial risk factor for worse survivorship free of any revision (hazard ratio (HR) = 17; P < 0.001) and any reoperation (HR = 14; P = 0.002). There were no implants that were revised for fracture or wear. Knee society function scores improved from a mean of 54 preoperatively to a mean of 75 postoperatively. A UKA is a durable and reliable option for primary osteonecrosis at eight years of follow-up. However, when performed for secondary osteonecrosis, it has a substantially higher failure rate, primarily related to the progression of osteonecrosis or development of osteoarthritis in the lateral compartment.

41134412,Similar clinical and survival outcomes between robotic-assisted cemented and cementless total knee arthroplasty.,"Cemented fixation remains the standard in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), but cementless techniques are gaining popularity, particularly in younger, more active patients. Robotic assistance may improve the accuracy of cementless implantation and promote favorable outcomes. A retrospective review was conducted of 130 cruciate-retaining primary TKAs performed using the ROSA® robotic-assisted system between October 2021 and September 2023 by a single high-volume surgeon. Patients received either a cementless Persona Trabecular Metal® (n = 80) or cemented Persona® (n = 50) prosthesis. Patient demographics, perioperative data, complications, and revisions were recorded. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) WOMAC, Oxford Knee Score, Knee Society Score, and Forgotten Joint Score-12 were collected preoperatively and at minimum one-year follow-up. Patients in the cementless group were younger (p < 0.001) and more frequently men (p = 0.003). Both groups showed significant improvement in all PROMs from baseline (p < 0.001), with no statistically significant differences in final PROMs between groups. One revision occurred in the cemented group (2.0%) due to stiffness and pain; two manipulations under anesthesia (MUA) were required in the cementless group (2.5%). No differences were observed in operative time or hospital length of stay. At short-term follow-up, cementless and cemented robotic-assisted TKAs demonstrated equivalent improvements in PROMs and survivorship. Cementless implants may represent a viable option in appropriately selected patients, particularly younger individuals, when combined with robotic precision. Long-term data are needed to confirm durability.","Vitale Umberto, Agarossi Matteo, Ruosi Luca, De Dona Ferdinando, Loppini Mattia, D'Amario Federico",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41134412/,"Humanitas University, Milan, Italy. umberto.vitale@humanitas.it.; IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Rozzano, Milano, Italy. umberto.vitale@humanitas.it.; Humanitas San Pio X, Milano, Italy.; Humanitas University, Milan, Italy.; IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Rozzano, Milano, Italy."

The KLIC (Kidney, Liver, Index Surgery, Cemented Prosthesis, C-reactive Protein) score has been developed to aid in patient selection, but it is unclear if it does so reliably. We aimed to externally validate the KLIC score in a cohort of patients who have early and late acute periprosthetic joint infection. Retrospective data were used from five sites across four countries. In total, 199 had an infected hip prosthesis and 376 had an infected knee prosthesis. Treatment failure was defined as: (i) prosthesis removal for any reason, (ii) infection relapse determined by the treating clinician, or (iii) additional DAIR performed > seven days after the initial procedure. Nonparametric estimation of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was used to establish discriminative performance. A total of 240 of 575 (42%) patients met the criteria of treatment failure, with similar failure rates among hip (84 of 199, 42%) and knee (156 of 376, 41%) infections. There was no significant difference when comparing discriminative performance in patients who had infections of the hip (AUC: 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45 to 0.61) or knee (AUC: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.60) (P = 0.25), with limited discriminative performance in both cohorts.

41093152,Cementless versus Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty: A 5-Year Survivorship Analysis.,"The use of cementless fixation in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has increased considerably in recent years. However, there remains a paucity of midterm survivorship data comparing cementless fixation to cemented fixation. The purpose of this study was to compare cementless and cemented TKA in terms of (1) the incidence of aseptic loosening and all-cause revision at one, two, and five years, and (2) 5-year implant survivorship. A retrospective review was performed using a national all-payer claims database to identify patients who underwent primary TKA between 2015 and 2022. International Classification of Diseases-10th edition-procedure codes were used to determine the fixation method. We excluded patients who had less than five years of follow-up, trauma-related procedures, or malignancy. Propensity score matching was conducted based on age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and multiple comorbidities, yielding two cohorts: cementless (n = 5,526) and cemented (n = 5,538). Outcomes included the incidence of aseptic loosening and all-cause revision at one, two, and five years. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess 5-year survivorship. At one year, the incidence of aseptic loosening was similar between cementless and cemented TKA groups (0.3 versus 0.3%, P = 0.730), as was all-cause revision (1.9 versus 1.7%, P = 0.151). At two years, aseptic loosening remained similar (0.6 versus 0.6%, P = 1.000), as did all-cause revision (2.7 versus 2.5%, P = 0.537). At 5 years, the incidence of aseptic loosening was 0.9 versus 1.2% (P = 0.165), and all-cause revision was 3.7 versus 3.8% (P = 0.781). In the cementless cohort, 5-year survivorship was 99.1% for aseptic loosening and 96.3% for all-cause revision.

41072562,Mechanical Load-To-Shear Failure of Cemented Patellar Components in Well-Functioning Postmortem Total Knee Arthroplasties.,"Shear forces on the patella can lead to patellar loosening and failure in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Our objectives were as follows: (1) evaluate the mechanical load-to-shear failure in a unique cohort of cemented patellar components in well-functioning postmortem TKAs and (2) determine the influence of clinical and radiographic factors on load-to-shear failure. There were 22 patellae that were harvested from well-functioning postmortem TKAs (mean implantation duration 9.1 years [range, 1.7 to 19.6]). There were three all-polyethylene 3-peg onlay patellar designs evaluated. The patellae were evaluated for polyethylene damage, implant-to-bone size ratios, microarchitectural parameters, and implant-cement-bone interface. Patellar specimens were loaded with isolated shear stress using a servo-hydraulic test frame until failure. Univariate and multivariable linear regression models were used to analyze the influence of clinical and radiographic factors on load-to-shear failure. The mean load-to-shear failure was 1,881 ± 621 N. There were nine patellae that failed at the bone-cement interface, seven that failed at the implant-cement interface, and six that involved both interfaces. There were no failures at the peg-implant junction. On multivariable analyses, load to failure was positively associated with bone volume fraction and negatively associated with body mass index, duration of implantation, and implant-to-bone surface area coverage. Load-to-shear failure was not associated with surface damage or radiographic parameters and did not differ across the three patellar implant designs. In this novel cohort of cemented patellar buttons from well-functioning postmortem TKAs, load-to-shear failure was higher than previously reported in buttons cemented in cadaver native patellae. The amount of bony coverage by the patellar button was inversely associated with shear strength after accounting for other pertinent factors. When choosing between two patellar button sizes, surgeons should consider opting for the smaller size, which may improve the maximum shear strength of the patellar construct.","LeBrun Drake G, Sacher Sara E, Siljander Breana, Baral Elexis C, Breighner Ryan E, Potter Hollis G, Hopper Robert H, Wright Timothy M, Engh Charles A, Padgett Douglas E",The Journal of arthroplasty,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41072562/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Adult Reconstruction and Joint Replacement, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York.; Department of Biomechanics, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York.; Department of Radiology, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York.; Anderson Orthopedic Research Institute, Alexandria, Virginia."
41072557,Outcomes after Contemporary Cementless Versus Cemented Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty at Five Years: Some Subtle Differences.,"Cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has regained interest due to the potential long-term survivorship and ease of use. However, data on contemporary cementless TKA remain limited. We investigated implant survivorship and outcomes following contemporary cementless versus cemented TKA. We identified 3,763 primary TKAs for osteoarthritis from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2023, using our institutional total joint registry (TJR). There were 598 cementless and 3,165 cemented TKAs. Cementless tibial components included porous titanium (Ti) in 509 knees and beaded cobalt-chromium (CoCr) in 89 knees. We excluded all-polyethylene tibias, stemmed tibias, and revision constructs. The mean age was 68 years (range, 28 to 96), the mean body mass index (BMI) was 32 (range, 17 to 65), and 56% were women. The cementless group was younger and contained more men (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and surgical year were performed. The mean follow-up was three years (range, two to eight years). There were 61 revisions (1.6%): 11 (1.8%) in the cementless and 50 (1.6%) in the cemented group. Revisions were primarily for infection (N = 31) and aseptic loosening (N = nine). All four loosening cases after cementless TKA involved CoCr tibias within 1 year. All five cemented TKA loosening cases occurred between two and five years. The 5-year revision-free survivorship was 92% in cementless and 97% in cemented TKAs (hazard ratio (HR) = 3; P < 0.05). Excluding CoCr tibias, Ti cementless survivorship was 97%. The 5-year survivorships free from revision for infection were 98% in cementless and 99% in cemented TKAs (hazard ratio = 3; P < 0.05). There were no differences in periprosthetic fracture risk observed (P = 0.5). We identified subtle differences between contemporary cementless and cemented primary TKA mid-term outcomes. We found a slightly higher infection risk in the cementless group, excellent durability of Ti cementless and cemented tibias, and a higher loosening risk with CoCr cementless tibias.

41042028,Comparison of mid-term survival of uncemented total knee arthroplasties with modular tibial components made of porous tantalum vs. cemented total knee arthroplasties.,"Cementless total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) with porous tantalum tibial components were developed to improve fixation and reduce implant failure rates in younger, active patients. However, mid-term outcomes remain uncertain. This retrospective study compared survival rates of cementless TKAs with porous tantalum posterior-stabilized (PS) modular tibial components to cemented PS components from the same implant system, using revision for aseptic loosening as the endpoint. From January 2017 to November 2021, 899 TKAs were performed at a single tertiary center for osteoarthritis. Of these, 645 (71.7%) were cemented and 254 (28.3%) cementless. Median BMI was similar in both groups (30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs 31.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>p</i> = 0.814). Cementless recipients were younger (median 66.0 vs. 72.0 years; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Follow-up continued through 31 December 2023. Seven-year survival was lower in the cementless group (97.1%, 95% CI 94.9-99.3) vs. cemented group (97.8%, 95% CI 96.6-99.0). Tibial component loosening led to 5 revisions in the cementless group vs. 2 revisions in the cemented group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Two cementless cases involved tibial tray fractures. Overall, 86 patients (9.6%) died of unrelated causes. Cementless porous tantalum TKAs had inferior mid-term performance for aseptic loosening, prompting their discontinuation at our institution.","Godicelj Žiga, Kastelic Jure, Levašič Vesna, Krajnc Zmago, Moličnik Andrej, Novak Igor, Naranđa Jakob, Zajc Jan, Fokter Samo K",Expert review of medical devices,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Tantalum, Aged, Male, Female, Tibia, Middle Aged, Porosity, Retrospective Studies, Bone Cements, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Failure, Prosthesis Design, Aged, 80 and over",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41042028/,"Faculty of Medicine, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia.; National Arthroplasty Registry of Slovenia, Valdoltra Orthopaedic Hospital, Ankaran, Slovenia.; Clinical Department of Orthopaedics, University Medical Centre Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia."
41039644,Assessing Implant Stability in Cementless Femoral Components With Different Interference Fits.,"Cementless total knee arthroplasty implants offer advantages over cemented implants, such as bone preservation and easier revision procedures. However, the optimal interference fit required to achieve a good press-fit fixation, essential for both primary and long-term stability, remains uncertain. This study uses finite element analysis to investigate the effects of two interference fits (350 µm and 700 µm) on micromotions, gap behavior, and plastic deformation at the bone-implant interface of a cementless femoral component under various loading conditions. Finite element models were developed using paired cadaveric femurs, incorporating microCT and optical scans. Micromotions were quantified as shear displacement, while gaps were quantified as normal displacement. Bone response was assessed by quantifying the volume of bone experiencing total equivalent plastic strain. The models showed moderate correlation with experimental results, predicting 35% of displacement variability. Although high interference fit implants slightly reduced micromotions and gaps, these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.252 and p = 0.759, respectively). The high interference fit implants exhibited significantly greater plastic deformation (+15.7%, p = 0.031), particularly at the posterior femoral condyles. These findings suggest that while an increased interference fit does not enhance primary stability, it may lead to more plasticity in the bone, potentially leading to more damage. Thus, optimizing the interference fit is crucial to balance implant fixation and minimize bone damage.","Sánchez Esther, Schilling Christoph, Grupp Thomas M, Giurea Alexander, Verdonschot Nico, Janssen Dennis",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41039644/,"Orthopaedic Research Laboratory, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.; Aesculap AG, Research and Development, Tuttlingen, Germany.; Department of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery, Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Munich, Germany.; Department of Orthopedics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; University of Twente, Laboratory for Biomechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering Technology, Enschede, the Netherlands."
41027587,Radiological and clinical outcomes of cementless versus cemented implants in total knee arthroplasty : a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"With the increasing use of cementless implants for primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of contemporary cementless designs of TKA compared with cemented TKA. Adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, a review of medical databases including Cochrane Registry, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and grey literature was conducted. The search included studies published since 2010 and encompassed only the current generation of cementless implants. Quality assessment was performed using the ROB-2/ROBIN-I risk of bias tools. The search yielded 23 randomized controlled trials and 45 observational studies which met the inclusion criteria. A total of 31 outcome metrics, including clinical and functional outcomes, were analyzed. Subgroup analysis was based on the patient's age. Meta-analysis of all-cause and aseptic survival at specific timepoints between one and 19 years postopertaively showed no significant difference between the groups. Subgroup analysis for individual patients aged < 60 years showed significant differences favouring cementless implants up to 14 years. Overall migration, measured at one and five years, was significantly higher for cementless implants (p < 0.001), with comparable migration at ten years (p = 0.43). Meta-analysis of most clinical outcomes showed equivalence up to 20 years, though some metrics favoured cementless implants. Subscales of Knee Society Score function/pain revealed significant differences at two (p = 0.003) and five years (all p < 0.05) favouring cementless implants. Cementless groups also had significantly shorter operating times (p < 0.001) and lengths of stay in hospital (p = 0.003). Surgical complications were significantly more frequent in the cemented group (p < 0.001), as was the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (p = 0.002). This meta-analysis highlighted considerable variations in outcomes between cemented and cementless TKA, suggesting that newer designs of cementless implants may offer improved survival in patients aged < 60 years. There was early migration of cementless TKA with stabilization in the longer term and improvement in several clinical and functional outcomes favouring cementless over cemented implants.","Lisacek-Kiosoglous Anthony B, Fontalis Andreas, Powling Amber S, Muhammad Ibrahim, Valentine Varun, Jeong YouJin, Plastow Ricci, Haddad Fares S",The bone & joint journal,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Design, Bone Cements, Prosthesis Failure, Treatment Outcome, Cementation, Radiography",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41027587/,"Department of Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery, University College London Hospital, London, UK.; Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London, London, UK.; Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.; Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Princess Grace Hospital, London, UK.; The Bone & Joint Journal , London, UK."

This retrospective study included a consecutive series of patients who underwent RTKA using CCK components (Triathlon Total Stabilizer) in a non-designer centre, between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2019. There were 344 patients, who underwent 358 revision procedures (330 unilateral and 14 staged bilateral). Their median age was 70.5 years (IQR 63 to 77) and 197 (55.0%) were female. The SPECIFIC criteria were used to define the mode of failure. The median follow-up was 9.8 years (IQR 6.7 to 13.4). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were collected prospectively (preoperatively, at one year, and at final follow-up (mean 9 years (4 to 16)), using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and the EuroQol five-dimension three-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L). The indications for RTKA were loosening (n = 131, 36.6%), instability (n = 124, 34.6%), or infection (n = 54, 15.1%). At final follow-up, 102 patients (28.5%) had died, and 30 patients (30 RTKAs; 8.4%) had undergone at least one re-revision, which consisted of secondary patellar resurfacing and/or polyethylene exchange in ten patients (33.3%). The overall ten-year survival was 91.7% (95% CI 88.6 to 94.9); however, this differed significantly (p = 0.029) according to the indication for revision: aseptic loosening, 96.0% (95% CI 92.6 to 99.5); infection, 86.6% (95% CI 77.8 to 96.4); and instability, 85.3% (95% CI 77.4 to 93.9). There were significant (p < 0.001) improvements in PROMs at one year (OKS mean change (MC), 12 (95% CI 11 to 14); and EQ-5D-3L MC, 0.214 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.31)), which were sustained at the final follow-up (OKS MC, 9 (95% CI 7 to 11); and EQ-5D-3L MC, 0.172 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.23)). The patients who underwent revision for aseptic loosening had significantly better OKSs compared with those who underwent revision for infection or instability at both one year (p = 0.008) and at the final follow-up (p = 0.024). RTKA using a cemented CCK arthroplasty had excellent ten-year survival and clinically meaningful improvements in PROMs. However, revision for instability or infection was associated with significantly worse survival and PROMs.","Yapp Liam Z, Scott Chloe E H, Baxendale-Smith Leo, Burnett Richard, Clement Nick D",The bone & joint journal,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Female, Reoperation, Knee Prosthesis, Aged, Male, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies, Prosthesis Failure, Prosthesis Design, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Follow-Up Studies, Treatment Outcome, Bone Cements",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41027581/,"Department of Orthopaedics, Division of Clinical and Surgical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Division of Lower Limb Reconstruction, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.; Department of Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."
41027464,"National Trends in Use and Complications of Cemented, Cementless, Manual, and Robotic-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty: 2016-2022.","Cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has become a viable option in recent years, and there has been an increase in robotic-assisted technology. Although institutions may monitor their implant usage, the evolution of their use and complication rates have not been well described at a national level in the United States. Therefore, we sought to characterize the use and compare complications between cemented, cementless, manual, and robotic-assisted TKA across the United States.We retrospectively reviewed a commercial claims database and found 94,603 inpatient primary TKAs that were performed with cemented or cementless components between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2022. Records were reviewed for demographics, use of robotics, complications, and readmissions up to 90 days postoperatively.More cementless TKAs were performed each year, from 4.1% in 2016 to 12.3% in 2022 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.3, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The use of robotic technology increased each year from 7.7% in 2016 to 25.0% in 2022 (OR = 1.3, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and was more commonly used with cementless TKA (OR = 1.3, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Patient factors associated with cementless TKA included younger age (OR = 1.0, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and male sex (OR = 1.3, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Cementless TKA was a risk factor for explantation within 90 days postoperatively (OR = 1.5, <i>p</i> = 0.008), but not aseptic loosening (OR = 0.8, <i>p</i> = 0.6), periprosthetic fracture (OR = 0.2, <i>p</i> = 0.2), infection (OR = 1.3, <i>p</i> = 0.1), revision TKA (OR = 1.4, <i>p</i> = 0.1), manipulation under anesthesia (OR = 1.0, <i>p</i> = 0.9), deep vein thrombosis (OR = 0.9, <i>p</i> = 0.5), pulmonary embolism (OR = 1.2, <i>p</i> = 0.3), or blood transfusion (OR = 0.3, <i>p</i> = 0.1).The use of cementless and robotic TKA is increasing each year, although most inpatient primary TKAs are still performed with manual cemented technique. Although cementless TKA was found to be a risk factor for revision and explanation within 90 days, it was not associated with a specific cause of revision.

41026200,Over ten year follow-up results of a prospective and consecutive series of primary total knee arthroplasty with a multimodular total knee prosthesis.,"High survival rates up to ten years have been reported for total knee replacements (TKR). Publications beyond ten years have more diverse conclusions. To study the long-term survival and clinical results of a multi-modular TKR, we examined a series of 120 cases with a minimum ten-years follow-up. This is a prospective multicentric observational study operated for arthritis by five senior surgeons. No control group has been included. Different femoral components (posterior stabilized (PS) or cruciate retaining (PC) versions), different tibial baseplates, both in cemented or cementless versions, were associated with an PS, PC or rotating version (PR) polyethylene insert and a patellar resurfacing or a partial inlay polyethylene component. In some cases the patella was not implanted. At ten years 38 patients were deceased (31.7 %) and 25 patients were lost to follow-up (20.8 %). 57 patients were reviewed at ten years. The Kaplan Meier cumulative survival rate of the TKR, by considering revision for any reason as endpoint, at ten years is at 92.6% (CI: 86.2-96.1).They were two infections (1.7%) and eight other revisions for different reasons (6.7 %). Secondary IKS scores were statistically improved. Functional score was 79.4 points (p<0.001) and knee score was 89.2 (p<0.001). Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) were obtained in most of patients. Satisfaction of the patients was obtained in 93.75 % in a correspondence questionnaire. At ten year follow-up, this multi-modular TKR provides very good implant survival rates and clinical score with a high patient satisfaction.","Schwartz Claude, Mainard Didier, Vastel Laurent, Hummer Jacques, Hummer Nicolas",International orthopaedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41026200/,", Colmar, France. schwartzop@aol.com.; University of Lorraine, Nancy, France.; Raymond Poincaré University Hospital, Garches, France."
41026012,Can Hounsfield Unit Evaluation of Preoperative CT Scans Predict Surgeon's Preference of Cementless Fixation in Total Knee Arthroplasty?,"Adequate bone quality is necessary for reliable cementless fixation during total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Hounsfield Units (HUs) can be a useful surrogate of bone density, and therefore a proxy of bone quality. We sought to determine whether HU would correlate with subjective intraoperative assessment of bone quality and hence use of cementless fixation. A retrospective review of patients who underwent a robotic-assisted TKA between June 2022 and June 2024 by a single surgeon was conducted. HU measurements were obtained at three regions of interest (ROI) within the tibial plateau on preoperative axial-CT scans. Patients were divided into cementless or cemented tibial implant fixation groups based upon subjective intraoperative bone quality assessment. Demographic data such as age, sex, and BMI were collected. The final cohort included 630 patients. Cementless fixation was used in 58.3% of cases. Cementless patients had a higher combined overall average HU measurement (152.7 vs. 105.6, p < 0.001). Point-biserial correlation showed moderate inverse correlations between implant fixation type and HU measurements (all p < 0.001). ROC analysis and predictive modeling found that the best performance was derived from the combined model followed by combined demographics alone, and then HU measurements alone (AUC: 0.853 vs. 0.808 vs. 0.757). Standalone demographic resulted in the poorer predictive modeling. Ultimately, cementless fixation was associated with higher HU measurements compared to cemented fixation in all 3 ROI. HU in conjunction with combined demographic data offered the greatest confidence in predicting fixation type and therefore may be utilized to aid in decision-making and surgical planning for TKA.","Osondu Chukwuemeka U, Mosher Hannah, Brutti Jonathan, Remer Hallie B, Barra Matthew, Suarez Juan C",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Female, Retrospective Studies, Aged, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Middle Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Bone Density, Tibia",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41026012/,"Baptist Health Orthopedic Care, Baptist Health South Florida, Coral Gables, Florida, USA.; University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.; Florida International University Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA."
41025589,Five-year implant survival does not differ between hybrid and cementless total knee arthroplasty in a cohort of 5361 patients using a deep-dish mobile bearing design.,"This study compared total knee arthroplasty (TKA) outcomes between cementless and hybrid fixation, with separate analysis of tibial and femoral cementation. The primary hypothesis was that equivalence would exist in implant survivorship between cementless and hybrid fixation techniques. The secondary hypothesis was that cementless and hybrid TKAs would demonstrate comparable mid-term surgery-free survival rates, rates of aseptic reoperation and functional outcomes. A multicentre retrospective study was conducted using prospectively collected data from a large cohort, all implanted with the same deep-dish mobile bearing. Patients were divided according to the fixation method: fully cementless, femoral cemented/tibial uncemented and tibial cemented/femoral uncemented. The survival rates of cementless and hybrid TKA were compared with a median follow-up of 27 months. Evolution of functional outcomes (International Knee Society [IKS] score, range of motion [ROM]) from preoperative to 5-year follow-up were also compared. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance covariates (age, sex, body mass index and patellar procedure) between groups. Among the 5361 primary TKA included (4549 cementless, 435 tibial hybrid and 377 femoral hybrid), 1505 reached the 5-year follow-up. Five-year revision-free survival rate was 98.7% (95% confidence interval: 98.2; 99.1) for cementless, 97.8% (94.6; 99.1) for tibial hybrid (p = 0.537) and 98.4% (94.9; 99.5) for femoral hybrid (p = 0.669). Cumulative surgery-free survival rates and functional outcomes at 5 years showed no significant differences between groups with clinically comparable results. No difference in survivorship was observed between cementless and hybrid TKA at 5 years in this cohort of 5361 patients, whether the tibia or femur was cemented. Rates of reoperation and aseptic reoperation were also comparable, as were clinical outcomes. These results suggest that the choice between hybrid and cementless fixation does not impact mid-term TKA survival.

41020545,Dynamic computed tomography assessment of patellofemoral and tibiofemoral kinematics before and after total knee arthroplasty: A pilot study.,"To develop and evaluate the clinical feasibility of a dynamic computed tomography (CT) protocol for assessing patellofemoral (PF) and tibiofemoral (TF) kinematics before and after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and to quantify postoperative kinematic changes in a pilot study. In this prospective single-centre study, patients with primary osteoarthritis scheduled for cemented TKA underwent dynamic CT scans preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up during active flexion-extension-flexion. Preoperatively, the femur, tibia and patella were segmented using a neural network. Postoperatively, computer-aided design (CAD) implant models were aligned to CT data to determine relative implant-bone orientation. Due to metal artefacts, preoperative patella meshes were manually aligned to postoperative scans by four raters, and averaged for analysis. Anatomical coordinate systems were applied to quantify patellar flexion, tilt, proximal tip rotation, mediolateral translation and femoral condyle anterior-posterior translation. Descriptive statistics were reported, and interoperator agreement for patellar registration was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Ten patients (mean age, 65 ± 8 years; 6 men) were analysed across a shared flexion range of 14°-55°. Postoperatively, the patella showed increased flexion (median difference: 0.9°-3.9°), medial proximal tip rotation (median difference: 1.5°-6.0°), lateral tilt (median difference: 2.7°-5.5°), and lateral shift (median difference: -1.5 to -2.8 mm). The medial and lateral femoral condyles translated 2-4 mm anterior-posteriorly during knee flexion. Interoperator agreement for patellar registration ranged from good to excellent across all parameters (ICC = 0.85-1.00). This pilot study demonstrates that dynamic CT enables in vivo assessment of PF and TF kinematics before and after TKA. The protocol quantified postoperative kinematic changes and demonstrated potential as research tool.

This study evaluated, at a single center, mid-term survivorship and clinical outcomes for a mobile-bearing knee prosthesis with a titanium-niobium nitride (TiNbN) coating. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 150 patients who underwent primary cemented TKA using the same TiNbN-coated mobile-bearing prosthesis were identified through the institutional database. Of these, 102 patients (102 knees) attended the follow-up examination and provided informed consent to participate in this study. All patients underwent comprehensive clinical and radiological assessment. Primary outcomes were the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). <b>Results:</b> After a mean follow-up period of 7.9 years, two revision surgeries were recorded. One revision was performed due to late periprosthetic joint infection, while the other involved synovectomy and liner exchange due to persistent stiffness and pain. At 9 years follow-up, overall survivorship of the TiNbN-coated TKA was 97.1% (95% CI, 88.4-99.3%). Mean FJS and KOOS were 70.0 (range 29-100) and 70.6 (range 24-98), respectively. No sex-based differences were detected in clinical outcomes or implant survivorship. <b>Conclusions:</b> The TiNbN-coated mobile-bearing knee prosthesis demonstrated favorable mid-term survivorship and patient-reported outcomes. These findings support its use as a treatment option for knee osteoarthritis, with performance comparable to contemporary TKA designs.","Jure Serdar, Čimić Mislav, Delimar Domagoj",Journal of clinical medicine,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41010562/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University Hospital Center Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia."
40962210,"Primary Total Knee Fixation Methods in Morbidly Obese Patients: Cemented, Stemmed, and Cementless Designs.","Patients who had a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 pose challenges in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), particularly aseptic tibial loosening. This study compared survivorship, clinical outcomes, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of TKA using cemented tibiae with stems, cemented tibiae without stems, and cementless tibial designs in this high-BMI population. This retrospective cohort included 1,359 patients who had a BMI ≥ 40 undergoing primary TKA between 2010 and 2024. Patients were divided into three groups based on tibial design: cemented tibiae with stems, cemented tibiae without stems, and cementless tibiae. The primary outcome was implant survivorship. The secondary outcomes included revision for aseptic tibial loosening, revision for any reason, complications, PROMs, including the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, and Knee Society Score, as well as range of motion and tibiofemoral angle. Survivorship at one, two, and five years was highest in the cementless group; however, the differences were not statistically significant. There were no cases of aseptic tibial loosening observed in the cemented tibiae with stems group, while three cases (0.38%) occurred in the cemented tibiae without stems group, and one (0.36%) in the cementless group. Revision for any reason occurred in 2.33% of cases in the cemented tibiae with stems group, 2.17% in the cemented tibiae without stems group, and 0.36% in the cementless tibiae group. The PROMs improved in all groups with no significant postoperative differences. In morbidly obese patients undergoing primary TKA, all three tibial component designs demonstrated high survivorship with low rates of aseptic tibial loosening. While cementless designs showed promising early survivorship, cemented tibial stems had the lowest incidence of aseptic loosening. Our findings suggest that all fixation methods are viable options, with implant selection best guided by patient-specific factors and surgeon preference.","Nwankwo Tobenna N, Olson Nicholas R, Crowley Brandon M, Ho Henry P, Fricka Kevin B, Sershon Robert A",The Journal of arthroplasty,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40962210/,"Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute, Alexandria, Virginia.; MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, District of Columbia.; Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute, Alexandria, Virginia; Inova Mount Vernon Hospital Joint Replacement Center, Alexandria, Virginia."
40960648,[Good recovery of leisure activities and sport after primary implantation of cementless knee arthroplasty after 5 years : A retrospective study].,"The ability to resume sporting activities after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a key concern for many patients. While cementless implantation techniques are gaining relevance, long-term data on their impact on physical activity are limited. This study aimed to evaluate individual leisure activities and functional outcomes following cementless TKA over a five-year period. A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted on 42 patients (age 35-80 years) who underwent primary cementless TKA (Attune, DePuy) between April 2017 and April 2018. For each patient, the three most relevant sports were identified using the Knee Society Score (KSS) and compared pre- and postoperatively (1 and 5 years). Additionally, activity-related subscales of the KSS and KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) were evaluated. Statistical analyses included Wilcoxon, Friedman, and Spearman correlation tests. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) showed significant improvements in sports-related performance (p 0.05) at 1 and 5 years postoperatively. Pain during favorite sports decreased from ""severe"" to ""mild."" KSS activity subgroups improved from ""severe-moderate"" to ""moderate-mild,"" and KOOS subgroups from ""extreme-severe"" to ""moderate."" KSS and KOOS scores showed strong correlation. No aseptic loosening or periprosthetic infections were observed.ConclusionCementless TKA allows for a sustained return to sporting activity with significant symptom reduction over a five-year period, without increased risk of implant loosening. These findings support realistic patient counseling regarding postoperative expectations. This study demonstrates that patients benefit long term from a significant improvement in athletic ability after cementless TKA. Recent studies suggest that cementless techniques are not only equivalent to cemented approaches but may even be superior in certain aspects. The low loosening rate further supports the use of cementless TKA in physically active patients. Cementless TKA allows for a sustained return to athletic activities with a significant reduction in discomfort. No loosening occurred over the 5‑year period. The results of this study can aid in patient counseling to set realistic expectations regarding postoperative athletic performance.","Theiner Manish, Mehl Julian, Freund Norbert","Orthopadie (Heidelberg, Germany)",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40960648/,"Krankenhaus der Barmherzigen Schwestern Ried, 4910, Ried im Innkreis, Österreich.

40955102,Surgeon Learning Curve With Selection of New Total Knee Arthroplasty Implants and Risk of Revision: A Registry-Based Cohort Study.,"Prior studies have reported learning curves as surgeons adopt new technology/techniques. The authors sought to evaluate revision risk following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to assess whether a learning curve was observed as surgeons transitioned to 1) a new implant from the same manufacturer and 2) a new implant from a new manufacturer. Patients ≥ 18 years of age who underwent primary fixed bearing, posterior stabilized, fully cemented TKA with patella resurfacing were identified using a US integrated health care system's total joint replacement registry (2009-2023). The exposure groups were categorized in these groups: baseline implant (reference), first 50 TKA with new implant (≤ 50), second 50 (51-100), third 50 (101-150), and the remainder (> 150). A multiple Cox proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate revision risk with adjustment for confounders. The intra-manufacturer cohort comprised 42,743 TKA. A higher revision risk was observed for the ≤ 50 group compared to the baseline group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.86); no other differences were observed after the first 50 TKA (51-100: HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.71-1.34; 101-150: HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.69-1.32; > 150: HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.79-1.34). However, the association was no longer significant after excluding the TKA performed with the Attune fixed bearing tray, which has been associated with a higher risk of revision in the total joint replacement registry. The inter-manufacturer cohort comprised 19,817 TKA. No differences were observed when comparing a new manufacturer to the baseline manufacturer. Surgeons should be cautious for the first several TKA when transitioning to a new implant given the relationship between surgeon and implant on revision risk.

40953280,Cost-Neutral Thresholds With Cementless Fixation in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A 20-Year Markov Analysis.,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is increasingly performed in younger, high-demand patients, raising concerns about the long-term durability of traditional cemented implants. Noncemented TKA offers the potential for biologic fixation and improved longevity, but its cost-effectiveness remains uncertain. A Markov decision model was used to compare the 20-year cost of cemented versus noncemented primary TKA in a cohort of 10,000 patients beginning at age 50 years. The model incorporated implant costs, revision rates, operating room (OR) time, and other relevant clinical variables. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of implant failure rates, implant cost markups, and OR time savings. The 20-year cost of noncemented TKA ($20,829) was slightly higher than cemented TKA ($20,573). However, key variables markedly influenced cost-effectiveness. When the noncemented failure hazard ratio was reduced to 0.8, a cost savings of $1,676 was observed. Conversely, a hazard ratio of 1.2 led to a $1,768 increase in cost. A cost-neutral threshold was achieved with a 19% noncemented implant markup or 13 minutes of OR time saved. Additional savings were observed when OR time costs exceeded $54 per minute. Other variables, such as cement cost and patient age, had minimal impact. Cementless TKA can be cost-neutral or cost saving over 20 years if specific conditions such as implant pricing and reduced OR time are met. Although clinical outcomes appear comparable between implant types, careful consideration of cost drivers and institutional practices is necessary. Noncemented TKA may be a viable, cost-effective option in selected patient populations, although further research is needed to refine these thresholds and evaluate long-term outcomes.","Booth Michael, Box Hayden, Bedair Hany",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40953280/,"From the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA (Booth, Box, and Bedair), and the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Newton- Wellesley Hospital, Newton, MA (Box and Bedair)."
40936882,Modern Perspectives on Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: An Editorial Review.,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has emerged as a reliable, bone-preserving option for patients with isolated compartment knee osteoarthritis (OA). Initially limited by poor early outcomes and narrow indications, advances in implant design, patient selection, and surgical technique have led to a resurgence in its use. Contemporary diagnostics rely on precise clinical and imaging assessments to confirm unicompartmental disease while ruling out contraindications. Importantly, traditional exclusion criteria, such as age under 60, high body mass index, patellofemoral OA, anterior cruciate ligament deficiency, and chondrocalcinosis, are being re-evaluated in light of newer evidence, suggesting they are not absolute barriers in all patients. Operative options now include cemented and cementless fixation, fixed- and mobile-bearing designs, and all-polyethylene versus metal-backed components, each with specific advantages and limitations. Robotic-assisted techniques offer improved alignment accuracy and reproducibility compared to conventional manual approaches, potentially enhancing survivorship, although cost and learning curve remain considerations. Post-operative protocols support early mobilization and weight-bearing, facilitating faster recovery than total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Return to sports activity is generally higher after UKA, meeting the expectations of increasingly active patient populations. Surgeon-related factors, particularly experience and case volume, significantly influence outcomes, underscoring the importance of appropriate training and patient selection. As the understanding of UKA indications and techniques continues to evolve, it offers a compelling, less invasive alternative to TKA for well-selected patients. This editorial review highlights current best practices, emerging evidence, and ongoing challenges in optimizing outcomes for UKA.","Rajani Amyn M, Shyam Ashok",Journal of orthopaedic case reports,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40936882/,"OAKS Clinic, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.; Department of Orthopaedics, Sancheti Institute for Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, Pune, Maharashtra, India."
40936872,Rare Periprosthetic Fractures Following Oxford Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: A Case Series of Supracondylar Femoral and Proximal Tibial Fractures.,"Periprosthetic fractures (PPFs) are well-documented complications after total knee arthroplasty but are exceedingly rare following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Given UKA's design preserves native bone stock and maintains near-normal joint biomechanics, PPFs around well-fixed UKA components are infrequently encountered and poorly described in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, there are very few detailed reports of supracondylar femoral or proximal tibial PPFs following mobile-bearing UKA. This case series is important because it highlights not only the rarity of these injuries but also their successful management without compromising the integrity of the prosthetic components. We present two unique cases of PPFs following cemented mobile-bearing Oxford UKA in elderly South Asian women. The first case involves a 63-year-old woman who sustained a high-energy supracondylar femoral PPF (Unified Classification System Type C) 9 months post-UKA. Despite the severity of the injury, radiographs confirmed the femoral component remained well-fixed with no evidence of polyethylene insert dislocation. She was treated successfully with retrograde intramedullary nailing, achieving full fracture union and 130° of knee flexion by 6 months postoperatively. The second case involves a 60-year-old woman who sustained a proximal third tibial PPF (Type C) two and a half months after UKA. Again, both components remained secure without signs of loosening. She was treated with locking plate fixation, resulting in complete union and full independent ambulation by 6 months. Both patients remained clinically well at 2.5 years of follow-up, with intact UKA components and no functional limitations. These cases underscore that even severe, high-energy PPFs around UKA can be effectively managed with standard anatomical fixation techniques without necessitating implant revision. The report advances clinical knowledge by demonstrating the structural resilience of well-fixed mobile-bearing UKA components in the setting of traumatic fracture. It is of particular interest to orthopaedic surgeons specializing in arthroplasty and trauma, but also has broader implications for surgical planning, patient counseling, and post-operative expectations.","Rajani Amyn M, Kulkarni Vishal, Desouza Clevio",Journal of orthopaedic case reports,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40936872/,"OAKS Clinic, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."

A posterior-stabilized knee system (Smith and Nephew, femur-5, tibia-5, polyethylene insert 13 mm) was implanted using Palacos bone cement. The patient recovered well and regained mobility with significant pain relief. In rare cases of non-union Hoffa's fractures with joint degeneration, combined TKA and ORIF can provide functional improvement and pain relief, even in younger adults, when performed with appropriate surgical planning.","Khatri S S, Shekhawat Namrata",Journal of orthopaedic case reports,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40936851/,"Robotics by Khatri, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India."
40929364,Should We Always Use a Metaphyseal Cone in Conjunction With Tibial Augments for Uncontained Defects? A Finite-element Biomechanical Analysis.,"Choosing the appropriate implants for reconstruction in revision TKA is essential for long-term fixation. While cones and augments are routinely utilized to address tibial defects, the effect of augment location and size on the biomechanical stability of revision TKA constructs and the indications for the use of metaphyseal cones are not known. Is the risk of cement-implant debonding of revision TKA constructs impacted by the thickness and location (medial versus bicompartmental) of tibial augments and the presence of metaphyseal cones during (1) a demanding daily activity like stair ascent and (2) torsional loads? Under institutional review board approval, we developed patient-specific finite-element models of revision TKA from four patients (three males and one female, ages 50 to 80 years, BMI 27 to 37 kg/m 2 ) who underwent two-stage revision and had a CT scan with no metal artifact after first-stage implant removal. For each patient, we created 5-mm, 10-mm, and 15-mm-thick medial and bicompartmental uncontained defects. We considered two situations for the metaphysis: using a metaphyseal cementless cone into which the implant was cemented or using only cement to fill the metaphyseal cavity. To answer our first question, we conducted finite-element simulations of the immediate postoperative loading scenario representative of stair ascent, while to answer our second research question, we considered an idealized torsional test consisting of 100 N of axial load and twice the axial moment experienced at the same instant of stair ascent. We calculated the risk of cement-implant debonding from an interfacial failure function (calculated as a function of the normal and shear stresses at the cement-implant interface) wherein values of interfacial failure ≥ 1 indicate debonding. Our primary outcome was the cement-implant interface area with ≥ 10% risk of debonding, which we considered to be the interface area with greater than minimal risk of debonding. During stair ascent, we computed a decrease of the cement-implant interface area with greater than minimal risk of debonding (that is, ≥ 10% risk of debonding) with medial uncontained defects (median [IQR] 2.6% [1.4% to 3.7%] with 15-mm augment) but not with bicompartmental defects (5.2% [3.7% to 5.3%]) compared with the scenario with no uncontained defect (5.2% [3.9% to 5.9%]). Compared with using a metaphyseal cone, using cement alone in the metaphysis increased the interfacial area with greater than minimal risk of debonding, reaching a median (IQR) of 13.8% (11.4% to 14.3%) with a 15-mm bicompartmental defect. Under the torsional load scenario, the increase in the area with greater than minimal risk of debonding was small for medial defects, from a median (IQR) of 4.3% (2.5% to 5.3%) to 4.9% (3.9% to 6.2%) when using a metaphyseal cone and from 7.0% (4.0% to 9.5%) to 7.2% (6.1% to 9.8%) when only using cement in the metaphysis. However, the area at risk of failure of bicompartmental defects under torsional loads reached 23% when using a metaphyseal cone and 52% when using only cement in the metaphysis. The size of bicompartmental uncontained defects treated with a bicompartmental augment (a full block) negatively affected the overall construct stability in our finite-element model. However, medial defects of the same size did not negatively influence the stability of the construct when addressed with an augment perfectly contacting the bone. In our computational finite-element model, using metaphyseal cones increased the stability of the revision TKA construct. Our finite-element results suggest that medial augments have little impact on the stability of revision TKA constructs, but clinicians may want to combine bicompartmental augments with cones for increased stability of revision TKA constructs.","Quevedo González Fernando J, Hughes Andrew J, Brenneis Marco, Braun Sebastian, Sculco Peter K, Boettner Friedrich",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,"Humans, Finite Element Analysis, Aged, Male, Female, Middle Aged, Biomechanical Phenomena, Aged, 80 and over, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Tibia, Reoperation, Prosthesis Design, Knee Joint, Prosthesis Failure, Patient-Specific Modeling, Bone Cements, Stress, Mechanical, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40929364/,"Department of Biomechanics, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, St. James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Orthopedics (Friedrichsheim), University Hospital, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.; Center for Musculoskeletal Surgery, Charité - University Hospital Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Complex Joint Reconstruction Center, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA."

40896853,Aseptic loosening in non-augmentable versus augmentable tibial baseplate total knee arthroplasty designs: a single-centre comparative 10-year outcomes study.,"Aseptic tibial loosening is a leading cause of revision in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Previous work has highlighted concerns over the 5-year survivorship of a specific non-augmentable NexGen Legacy Posterior Stabilised (LPS) tibial baseplate. This study compares the long-term outcomes of augmentable versus non-augmentable tibial implants with a minimum 10-year follow-up. A retrospective analysis identified patients undergoing primary cemented TKA between 2009 and 2014. Patients were categorised by tibial baseplate type (augmentable vs. non-augmentable). The primary outcome was aseptic loosening, assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Secondary outcomes included overall revision rates and reasons for revision with a subgroup analysis by age and BMI. Among 1830 TKAs, revision rates were significantly higher in the non-augmentable group (6.4 % vs. 4.1 %; p = 0.036). Aseptic loosening was five times more common with non-augmentable implants (2.5 % vs. 0.7 %; p = 0.005). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly reduced survivorship in the non-augmentable group due to aseptic loosening (p = 0.0012, HR = 0.262), with a marked decline after 100 months. Patients under 65 with higher BMI had greater risk, with aseptic loosening occurring in 9.1 % of those with BMI > 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Non-augmentable NexGen LPS tibial implants are associated with higher rates of aseptic tibial loosening at long-term follow-up when used in combination with a posterior stabilised NexGen femoral implant. Younger, high-BMI individuals are at particular risk. These findings support the need for further investigation into the mechanisms of implant failure, as well as a more granular approach to data reporting within large-scale registries to avoid camouflage by more successful implants of the same brand.","Locke Saskia, Doonan James, Bailey Emma, Seymour-Jackson Emily, Campbell Nathan, Blyth Mark J G, Jones Bryn G",The Knee,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Prosthesis Failure, Knee Prosthesis, Retrospective Studies, Male, Female, Aged, Prosthesis Design, Reoperation, Middle Aged, Tibia, Follow-Up Studies, Aged, 80 and over",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40896853/,"Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, UK.

40890694,Biomechanical comparison of patellar cementing techniques in total knee arthroplasty: a biomechanical study.,"The aim of this study was to biomechanically compare three different cementing techniques for patellar component fixation in total knee arthroplasty.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthetic patellar bone model (Selbones© Research Laboratory, Kayseri, Turkey) was implanted with an all-polyethylene universal dome patellar component (Trauson<sup>®</sup> universal dome, Stryker, Changzhou, China) using bone cement (Surgical Simplex<sup>®</sup> P, Stryker, Limerick, Ireland). The test specimens were divided into three groups according to the cementing technique. Group 1 was named as ""partial cementing"", Group 2 as ""full cementing"" and Group 3 as ""modification"" technique. Modification technique was performed with a 50 cc injector. After fixation of the materials, the strength of fixation was tested biomechanically by applying force with isolated scissors produced using a tensile compression testing machine (UVE, Bursa-Turkey). Curves and peak stress pressures were statistically analyzed to determine which cementing technique provided the best fixation strength. The mean peak stress pressure of a total of 30 test specimens was 1305.86 (± 24.72) N (Newton) and these values were determined as 1013.00 (± 24.72), 1334.60 (± 37.17) and 1570.00 (± 26.56) N for group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively (p < 0.001). A statistically significant difference was found in the multiple comparisons of all groups with each other and fixation of group 3 was found to be better than group 1 and 2 (p < 0.001).  CONCLUSION: The modified cementing technique demonstrated superior biomechanical fixation strength compared to conventional methods in this in vitro study.

40867936,In Vivo Antibiotic Elution and Inflammatory Response During Two-Stage Total Knee Arthroplasty Revision: A Microdialysis Pilot Study.,"<b>Introduction</b>: Two-stage revision with an antibiotic-loaded, temporary static cement spacer is a common treatment for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) of the knee. However, limited data exists on in vivo antibiotic elution kinetics after spacer implantation. This pilot study uses the technique of microdialysis (MD) to collect intra-articular knee samples. The aim was to evaluate MD as an intra-articular sampling method to detect spacer-eluted antibiotics within 72 h after surgery and to determine whether they show specific elution kinetics. <b>Methods</b>: Ten patients (six male, four female; age median 71.5 years) undergoing two-stage revision for knee PJI were included. A MD catheter was inserted into the joint during explantation of the infected inlying implant and implantation of a custom-made static spacer coated with COPAL cement (0.5 g gentamicin (G) and 2 g vancomycin (V)). Over 72 h postoperatively, samples were collected and analyzed for spacer-eluted antibiotics, intravenously administered antibiotics (e.g., cefazolin and cefuroxime), metabolic markers (glucose and lactate), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Local and systemic levels were compared. <b>Results</b>: All catheters were positioned successfully and well tolerated for 72 h. Antibiotic concentrations in MD samples peaked within the first 24 h (G: median 9.55 µg/mL [95% CI: 0.4-17.36]; V: 37.57 µg/mL [95% CI: 3.26-81.6]) and decreased significantly over 72 h (for both <i>p</i> < 0.05, G: 4.27 µg/mL [95% CI: 2.26-7.2]; V: 9.69 µg/mL [95% CI: 3.86-24]). MD concentrations consistently exceeded blood levels (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while intravenously administered antibiotics showed higher blood concentrations. Glucose in MD samples decreased from 17.71 mg/dL to 0.89 mg/dL (<i>p</i> < 0.05). IL-6 and lactate concentrations showed no difference between MD and blood samples. <b>Conclusions</b>: Monitoring antibiotics eluted by a static spacer with intra-articular MD for 72 h is feasible. Gentamicin and vancomycin levels remained above the minimal inhibitory concentration. Differentiating infection from surgical response using metabolic and immunological markers remains challenging. Prolonged in vivo studies with MD are required to evaluate extended antibiotic release in two-stage exchanges.","Behrens Julika Johanna, Franz Alexander, Schildberg Frank Alexander, Rudowitz Markus, Grote Stefan, Fröschen Frank Sebastian","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40867936/,"Department of Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany.; Department of Trauma and Orthopedic Surgery, BG Klinik Ludwigshafen, 67071 Ludwigshafen, Germany.; Laboratory Dr. Wisplinghoff, 50858 Cologne, Germany.; Department of Orthopedics, Trauma and Hand Surgery, Barmherzige Brüder, Hospital St. Elisabeth, 94315 Straubing, Germany."
40875045,Cement or press-fit? Impact of patellar fixation technique on outcomes after primary TKA: a systematic review.,"The optimal fixation technique for patellar components in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA); cemented versus press-fit, remains controversial. While early press-fit designs were associated with complications, second-generation implants with improved osseointegration features have renewed interest in cementless fixation. This systematic review included studies comparing cemented and press-fit patellar fixation in primary TKA. A comprehensive literature search identified 202 studies, of which eight met predefined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted on survivorship, revisions, complications, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Across 1666 knees, survivorship was comparable between cemented and press-fit groups. Several studies reported 100% short-term survivorship in cementless cohorts. Four studies identified statistically significant PROM differences, but findings were inconsistent and context-dependent. No clear advantage was found for either fixation type in terms of overall pain, function, or satisfaction. Cementless patellae demonstrated no increased risk of aseptic loosening or patellar fracture. Complications were infrequent and more often reported in cemented groups. These findings showed no significant difference in failure or PROMs between fixation methods. While surgical preference remains a driver of implant choice, current evidence does not support a universal superiority of one fixation method over the other.","Giovanoulis Vasileios, Abboud Johnny, Vasiliadis Angelo V, Meissburger Victor, Koutserimpas Christos, Lustig Sebastien",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Bone Cements, Patella, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Design, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Prosthesis Failure",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40875045/,"Orthopaedics Surgery and Sports Medicine Department, Hôpital de la Croix-Rousse, Lyon, France. vasigiova@gmail.com.; Department of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery, Hôpital André Mignot, Le Chesnay, France. vasigiova@gmail.com.; Orthopedic Department, Hôpitaux Universitaires Henri-Mondor, Créteil, France.; Orthopaedics Surgery and Sports Medicine Department, Hôpital de la Croix-Rousse, Lyon, France.; Department of Anatomy, University of Thessaly, Volos, Greece.; Department of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery, Hôpital André Mignot, Le Chesnay, France.; School of Rehabilitation Health Sciences, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.; IFSTTAR, LBMC UMR_T9406, Claude Bernard University Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France."
40865698,Survivorship and Cause-Specific Revision Risk Following Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty Using a Newer Versus Older Generation Implant System From the Same Manufacturer.,"New implant systems have design modifications seeking to improve total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patient satisfaction and survivorship. We sought to determine whether there was a difference in overall and cause-specific aseptic revision risk between two successive modern TKA designs, both overall and when stratified by constraint type: posterior stabilized, ultracongruent, and cruciate retaining. Adult patients who underwent primary fully cemented TKA for osteoarthritis between 2009 and 2022 were identified using our institutional total joint arthroplasty registry. The study sample was restricted to patients who received either the newer (n = 54,113) or older (n = 39,990) generation implant system from the same manufacturer. Multivariable Cox regressions were used to evaluate risk for aseptic and cause-specific revision. The 9-year revision rate for both designs was around 2%. In adjusted analyses, the newer system had a higher aseptic revision risk compared to the older generation (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 1.37), as well as higher risks for loosening (HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.69) and instability (HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.58). By constraint, newer generation posterior stabilized bearings had higher risks for aseptic revision (HR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.37) and loosening (HR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.68). A higher instability risk (HR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.12 to 3.37) was observed for newer cruciate retaining, while a higher aseptic revision risk (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.85) was observed for newer ultracongruent. Although the overall revision risk was low, we found the newer system did not improve survivorship compared to the preceding system. Surgeons should be aware of these findings when determining polyethylene thickness and level of constraint with the newer system.

40865695,"Incidence, Timing, and Implications of Postoperative Manipulation Under Anesthesia (MUA) Following Cemented Versus Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA).","Recent increasing usage of cementless implants has raised the question of whether cemented versus cementless implants are more associated with the need for manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The current study utilized a large, national, administrative database to characterize the incidence of MUA after cemented versus cementless TKA and considered the potential association of MUA with revision rates. A large national database was queried for adult patients who underwent elective TKA. Those who had a contralateral TKA within six months of index surgery were excluded. Those who received cemented versus cementless TKA were determined and exactly matched 4:1 on age, sex, and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. The 6-month postoperative incidences of MUA were compared between subgroups. The 5-year prosthetic revision rates were compared between those who underwent MUA versus those who did not within each subgroup and between subgroups among those who underwent MUA, using log-rank tests. Of 567,715 TKA patients, cemented implants were used for 539,070 (95.0%) and cementless for 28,645 (5.0%). Matched cemented and cementless subcohorts included 114,496 and 28,624 patients and had similar postoperative MUA rates of 3.4% for both groups (P = 0.5). Compared to patients who did not undergo MUA, those who did had higher 5-year revision rates within both cemented (7.5 versus 2.7%, P < 0.01) and cementless groups (7.1 versus 3.0%, P < 0.01). Among patients who underwent MUA, revision rates were similar between cemented and cementless groups (7.5 versus 7.1%, P = 1). The 6-month postoperative incidences of MUA after TKA were equivalent between large, matched cemented and cementless populations (3.4% for both). While MUA was associated with decreased 5-year prosthetic survivorship for both cemented and cementless prostheses (underscoring its importance), it did not disproportionately impact rates for one versus the other.","Day Wesley, Maloy Gwyneth C, Rubin Lee E, Padela Muhammad T, Grauer Jonathan N, Hickernell Thomas R",The Journal of arthroplasty,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40865695/,"Department of Orthopaedics & Rehabilitation, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut."
40849786,Clinical Validation and Excellent Interobserver Agreement of Volumetric Matching Micromotion Analysis (V3MA) in Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"CT-based radiostereometric analysis (CT-RSA) is an alternative to RSA to measure implant migration. We performed a clinical validation study using VoluMetric Matching Micromotion Analysis (V3MA) software for CT-RSA. The aims of this study were to assess the agreement between V3MA and Model-based RSA software (for RSA), and to determine the interobserver agreement in V3MA. On a subset of patients included in a clinical trial, knee prosthesis tibial implant migration was measured between 1 and 5 years postoperative with V3MA and Model-based RSA software. V3MA and Model-based RSA results were compared by assessing the mean differences and limits of agreement (mean ± 1.96* standard deviation) using Bland-Altman analysis. V3MA migration results of two observers were compared using intraclass correlation (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. Twenty-four patients were included in the analysis. The mean difference (limits of agreement [LOA]) was -0.14 mm [-0.88 to 0.60] for maximum total point motion (MTPM). LOA for translations and rotations did not exceed ±0.5 mm and ±1°, respectively. The ICC (95% confidence interval) for MTPM between observers was 0.995 (0.989-0.998), and the mean difference [LOA] was 0.04 mm [-0.17 to 0.24]. We showed that between 1 and 5 years postoperative, V3MA migration results were comparable to those of Model-based RSA for cemented tibial component migration in a clinical study. The interobserver variability showed excellent agreement for V3MA. Overall, V3MA is a valid alternative to Model-based RSA for the analysis of tibial component migration in TKA with medium-term follow-up.","de Laat Nienke N, Koster Lennard A, Robertson Jessie E, Nelissen Rob G H H, Kaptein Bart L",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Radiostereometric Analysis, Male, Aged, Female, Observer Variation, Middle Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Aged, 80 and over, Software, Prosthesis Failure",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40849786/,"Department of Orthopaedics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.; Biomedical Engineering Program, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada."
40845512,Tibial tray stability in three cementless total knee arthroplasty systems.,"Initial stability of cementless total knee arthroplasty tibial trays is necessary for bony ingrowth. The purpose of this study was to characterize the patterns and magnitudes of displacement of three implant systems during physiological loading in terms of tibial tray movement and 3D micromotion. Physiological loading (walking and stair descent) from a representative subject was robotically applied to cementless tibial trays implanted in foam tibia models. Three commercially available total knee arthroplasty systems with cementless tibial trays with keels and peripheral pegs from two different manufacturers were tested including symmetric, asymmetric and anatomically shaped tibial trays. Relative displacement between the foam tibia model and tibial tray in response to loading was measured at ten peripheral locations using an optical measurement system. All systems showed inferior movement of the posterior tibial tray in response to posterior located tibiofemoral loading, and superior movement of the anterior tibial tray. The system with an anatomic tibial tray design had significantly less micromotion than the systems with an asymmetric and symmetric tibial tray designs during walking (symmetric: 229 ± 30 μm, asymmetric: 205 ± 54 μm, anatomic: 84 ± 22 μm; p < 0.001) and less micromotion than the symmetric tibial tray during stair descent (symmetric: 165 ± 17 μm, asymmetric: 151 ± 65 μm, anatomic: 92 ± 18 μm; p < 0.002).

40842796,Low Rates of Early Aseptic Loosening of the Cemented Attune S+ Total Knee Arthroplasty System.,"Background Aseptic loosening is a common cause of late revision surgery performed following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Recent advances in implant designs have aimed at reducing this risk, with the cemented Attune S+ total knee system focused on improving stability through enhanced cement adherence. Despite excellent preliminary in vitro data, there is a lack of clinical studies assessing the performance of this implant, with prior studies reporting high rates of aseptic loosening. The primary objective of this study was to assess the clinical outcomes, primarily rates of aseptic loosening and revision, of Attune S+ implants. Methodology This retrospective study included 47 patients who underwent TKA using the cemented Attune S+ system between November 2017 and April 2023. All surgeries were performed by a single fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeon at a tertiary care academic medical center. The primary outcome was aseptic loosening, which was evaluated on postoperative knee radiographs for stress shielding and radiolucent lines. Results There were no patients with radiographic evidence of aseptic loosening, and no known revision surgeries were performed. Of note, one patient had a subsequent operation 817 days after the original TKA to remove scar tissue in the knee joint due to arthrofibrosis, but no signs of prosthetic failure were found intraoperatively. Conclusions In this study, there were no cases of aseptic loosening or revision surgery observed with the cemented Attune S+ TKA system.","Sheridan McKenna, Krishnan Pranav, Farooq Hassan, Grayson Whisper, Rees Harold, Brown Nicholas",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40842796/,"Orthopaedic Surgery, Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, USA.; Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, USA."

Revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) in patients with bone cement hypersensitivity presents a unique challenge. This study reports on four patients with clinical failure of TKA, three with confirmed allergy to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and one to benzoyl peroxide, as demonstrated by skin patch testing. All patients underwent rTKA using metaphyseal sleeves. In three cases, diaphyseal stems were also used. After a mean follow-up of 71.2 months, all patients experienced symptomatic improvement, with a mean increase in range of motion (ROM) of 12.5 degrees. There was a mean increase of 16, 75 points in Knee Society Score. None required additional surgery. In patients undergoing revision TKA due to confirmed allergy to bone cement and minimal bone loss, the use of metaphyseal sleeves-alone or in combination with stems-provides a viable cementless fixation strategy with promising mid-term outcomes.","Segura-Nuez Juan, Segura-Nuez Julián Carlos, Castaño-Doste María Belén, Roche-Albero Adrián, Martín-Hernández Carlos",The Knee,"Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Bone Cements, Hypersensitivity, Knee Joint, Knee Prosthesis, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Prosthesis Failure, Range of Motion, Articular, Reoperation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40840225/,"Miguel Servet Universitary Hospital, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Aragón (IISA), Spain; Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain.

40840224,Nitrided titanium alloy component enhances detection of small bone defects after total knee arthroplasty.,"This study compared the accuracy of various imaging modalities in detecting small bone defects simulating radiolucent lines (RLLs) around femoral components made of nitrided titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) versus cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy. Eight femoral components (four nitrided titanium alloy and four Co-Cr alloy) were implanted into pig femurs. Two total knee arthroplasty (TKA) models were fabricated for each component: normal and RLL TKA models. Fluoroscopically guided plain radiography, tomosynthesis, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. Thirty orthopaedic surgeons independently assessed the images to determine the presence or absence of bone defects. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were compared between materials and imaging modalities. The accuracy of detecting bone defects was significantly higher in nitrided titanium alloy components than in Co-Cr alloy components using fluoroscopically guided plain radiography (66.7 % vs. 53.3 %, P = 0.048), tomosynthesis (87.5 % vs. 63.3 %, P < 0.001), and CT (100 % vs. 61.7 %, P < 0.001). MRI showed no significant difference (52.5 % vs. 55.8 %, P = 0.698). Furthermore, for nitrided titanium alloy components, the accuracy of detecting bone defects around the femoral components using CT was 100 %. Small bone defects simulating RLLs were more easily detected around nitrided titanium alloy femoral components than around Co-Cr alloy components. Nitrided titanium alloy femoral components may offer an advantage by enabling earlier detection of loosening and potentially reducing the need for complex revision surgery. These findings may serve as one of several factors for surgeons to consider when selecting implant materials for TKA.","Masuda Sho, Minoda Yukihide, Ohyama Yohei, Sugama Ryo, Ohta Yoichi, Terai Hidetomi",The Knee,"Titanium, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Swine, Animals, Knee Prosthesis, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Chromium Alloys, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Fluoroscopy, Femur, Prosthesis Design, Alloys",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40840224/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Osaka Metropolitan University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Osaka Metropolitan University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.

40840222,Real-implant articulating spacers for chronic knee prosthetic joint infection have similar infection control rates as all-cement spacer constructs.,"Antibiotic eluting cement spacers are commonly used to treat prosthetic joint infection (PJI) in the setting of knee arthroplasty, however, controversy exists regarding the optimal spacer design. The purpose of this study was to evaluate: 1) post-operative 30-day complications; 2) reoperations over the study period; 3) and ultimate infection control between real-implant versus all-cement spacers in the setting of two-stage revision treatment for chronic knee PJI. We hypothesize that complications and infection control outcomes will be similar between spacer constructs. This is a retrospective, tertiary referral, single-center analysis. Inclusion criteria included: chronic knee prosthetic joint infection undergoing planned two-stage revision, and minimum 1-year follow-up (mean 43 months) (N = 46 patients). Demographics, infection characteristics, surgical characteristics, and spacer type were collected. Multivariable logistic regressions evaluated associations of underlying demographic and treatment characteristics with outcomes. 30-day post-operative complication rates were not different between real-implant and all-cement spacer groups. In the real-implant group, 10/29 patients (34.5 %) had 30-day complications compared to 5/17(29.4 %) of all-cement spacer group (OR 5.68; 95 % confidence interval 0.39 to 82.96; p = 0.723). Unexpected reoperations were also similar between the two groups with 7/17 (41.2 %) of the all-cement group and 9/29 (31 %) of the real-implant group undergoing an unexpected reoperation (OR:0.40; 95 % CI: 0.04 to 3.93; p = 0.065). Infection control at final follow up was similar between the two groups with 12/17 (70.6 %) of the all-cement group and 26/29 (89.7 %) of the real-implant groups achieving infection control (p = 0.100). We found that post-operative complications, unexpected reoperations, and infection control outcomes were similar between all-cement and real-implant spacers. These results suggest that real-implant spacers may not compromise infection control outcomes while possibly providing functional benefits to patients after Stage I treatment for chronic PJI.","Wong Justin, Myers Thomas G, Ginnetti John G, Kaplan Nathan, Ramirez Gabriel, Ricciardi Benjamin F",The Knee,"Humans, Prosthesis-Related Infections, Retrospective Studies, Male, Female, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Reoperation, Aged, Middle Aged, Bone Cements, Chronic Disease, Prosthesis Design, Anti-Bacterial Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40840222/,"Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.; Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA; Center for Musculoskeletal Research, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.

40828988,Is Malignancy Associated With Arthroplasty? A Meta-analysis.,"Although implants have been linked to malignancies in other medical contexts, such as the relationship between anaplastic large cell lymphoma and breast implants, the potential association between orthopaedic implants and cancer remains unclear. Several studies have investigated this question, but findings have been inconsistent. A comprehensive meta-analysis is needed to clarify whether total joint arthroplasty increases the risk of malignancy. (1) Is receiving a THA or TKA associated with an increased risk of cancer? (2) Are certain implant types (such as metal-on-metal or cemented) associated with increased cancer risk? (3) Is follow-up duration associated with changes in observed cancer risk estimates? A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using PubMed, Embase, and SCOPUS to identify studies assessing cancer incidence rates in patients who received hip or knee arthroplasty compared to patients in control groups who did not receive arthroplasty. Databases were queried from inception through the final search date (November 23, 2024). Eligible studies reported or allowed derivation of an effect estimate comparing overall cancer incidence rates in recipients of THA or TKA with an external reference population. From 1838 screened articles, 16 studies were included, all of which provided extractable effect estimates that were entered into one or more of our meta-analyses. Included studies consisted primarily of record-linkage studies connecting national, longitudinally maintained arthroplasty registers to similarly longitudinal national mortality and cancer registers. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, which awards up to nine points across three categories, with higher scores indicating lower risk of bias. The 16 included studies scored between 6 and 8 (mean ± SD 7.1 ± 0.8), reflecting generally high methodological quality. The primary analysis included data from 977,465 patients of both sexes and all age groups who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty and were followed up for over 7,415,134 person-years. Effect estimates were pooled with a random-effects model because heterogeneity was present (between-study σ 2 = 0.016 versus within-study σ 2 = 0.002; Q = 1195, p < 0.001), and a funnel plot showed no evidence of publication bias. To explore associations between implant type and cancer risk for patients undergoing THA, we conducted separate meta-analyses for studies reporting on metal-on-metal bearing surfaces and those reporting on cemented fixation. To assess latency effects, we compared cancer incidence rates in patients with more or less than 10 years of follow-up and conducted a meta-regression to evaluate the association between follow-up duration and cancer risk. We did not perform an a priori power analysis. Patients who underwent THA or TKA did not have an increased risk of cancer compared with the general population (pooled random-effects estimate [REE] = 0.99 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.07]; p = 0.88). Subgroup analyses showed no increased cancer risk after TKA (pooled REE = 1.02 [95% CI 0.85 to 1.21]; p = 0.83) or THA (pooled REE = 0.99 [95% CI 0.91 to 1.07]; p = 0.73). Cancer risk did not increase among patients undergoing THA who received cemented implants (pooled REE = 1.00 [95% CI 0.87 to 1.15]; p = 0.93) or metal-on-metal implants (pooled REE = 1.02 [95% CI 0.85 to 1.21]; p = 0.86) compared with the general population. Among patients with ≥ 10 years of follow-up, cancer incidence did not differ from the general population (pooled REE = 1.05 [95% CI 0.97 to 1.14]; p = 0.21); similarly, among patients with < 10 years of follow-up, no increased cancer risk was observed (pooled REE = 0.93 [95% CI 0.81 to 1.06]; p = 0.27). Meta-regression showed no association between follow-up duration and cancer risk (β = -0.004 [95% CI -0.024 to 0.015]; p = 0.66). Based on these findings, clinicians can continue to recommend arthroplasty without additional cancer-related concern based on current evidence. However, future studies should ensure longer follow-up, improved global representation in large linkage studies, and detailed patient- and implant-specific data to better characterize potential rare or long-latency malignancies.

40813747,Antimicrobial 3D printed implants for periprosthetic joint infections.,"Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) remain a serious complication following hip and knee arthroplasty, affecting 1-5% of patients in developed countries and posing significant challenges to patients, clinicians, and healthcare systems. Conventional prophylactic strategies, such as antibiotic-loaded bone cement, suffer from limited post-implantation drug release and potential compromise of mechanical integrity. To overcome these limitations, we developed a personalized, 3D-printed implant designed to integrate with the acetabular component of joint prostheses. These implants deliver either monotherapy or a combination of amphotericin B (AmB) and vancomycin (VAN), targeting both fungal and bacterial pathogens. Fabricated via fused deposition modeling using a biocompatible polyvinyl alcohol-polyethylene glycol (PVA-PEG) matrix, the implants enable passive drug loading and rapid adhesion to prosthetic surfaces within 60 s, minimizing operative time. In vitro testing confirmed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Candida spp. (C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. krusei) and Staphylococcus spp. (S. aureus, S. epidermidis). VAN was released rapidly, while AmB exhibited sustained release for up to 10 h, with both maintaining saturation solubility for 48 h. Notably, AmB-loaded implants showed five-fold lower hemolytic toxicity compared to free drug. These results highlight the potential of 3D-printed, drug-eluting implants as a clinically viable solution for the prevention and early treatment of PJIs.","Yuste Iván, Luciano Francis C, Rodríguez Carmina, Ramirez Bianca I, Rapti Chrysi, Anaya Brayan J, Lalatsa Aikaterini, Ribed-Sánchez Almudena, Sanz-Ruiz Pablo, González-Burgos Elena, Serrano Dolores R",Drug delivery and translational research,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40813747/,"Pharmaceutics and Food Technology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Plaza Ramón y Cajal s/n, Madrid, 28040, Spain.; Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.; School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Robertson Wing, University of Strathclyde, 161, Cathedral Street, Glasgow, G4 0RE, Scotland, UK.; Hospital Pharmacy Unit, Hospital General Universitario, Doctor Esquerdo 46, Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, 28029, Spain.; Orthopaedic and Trauma Department, Hospital General Universitario, Gregorio Marañón, Doctor Esquerdo 46, Madrid, 28029, Spain.; Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.; Department of Pharmacology, Pharmacognosy and Botany, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain. elenagon@ucm.es.; Pharmaceutics and Food Technology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Plaza Ramón y Cajal s/n, Madrid, 28040, Spain. drserran@ucm.es.; Faculty of Pharmacy, Instituto Universitario de Farmacia Industrial, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, 28040, Spain. drserran@ucm.es."
40812458,Biomechanical Analysis of Cement-Screw Technique for Tibial Bone Defects in Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"The cement-screw technique stands out as an effective method for addressing tibial bone defects in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, the absence of consensus regarding the optimal angle for screw implantation poses a challenge. This study aimed to investigate the most suitable screw implantation angle for repairing tibial bone defects in TKA, with a focus on biomechanical considerations. The angle of screw implantation was categorized into four groups: 0, 15, 30, and 45° relative to the tibial mechanical axis. Finite-element analysis was used to assess stress distribution and displacement in each group model. Static compression mechanical tests were conducted to evaluate the displacement generated by each group model. In addition, high-cycle fatigue compression tests were performed to assess the displacement and structural stiffness of each group model. The finite-element analysis results indicated that at a screw implantation angle of 15°, the maximum stress on the screw, cement in the defect, prosthesis, and cement under prosthesis is minimized, with the least displacement of the screw. Biomechanical test results demonstrated that a 15° screw implantation angle led to minimum displacement and maximal structural stiffness in the model. The screw implantation angle of 15° provides a biomechanical advantage in the cement-screw technique context for TKA tibial bone defects.","Liu Dehua, Lu Qunshan, Li XueZhou, Du Longzhuo, Sun Houyi, Liu Peilai",The Journal of arthroplasty,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40812458/,"Department of Orthopaedics, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China; Department of Orthopaedics, The First Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.; Department of Orthopaedics, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China."

Patients were stratified into cemented (n = 63, women/men 71/29%, mean age 70 ± nine years, BMI 29 ± 4) and cementless (n = 56, women/men 34/66%, mean age 72 ± eight years, BMI 28 ± 4) groups. Demographics were similar between groups, except for sex, with more men in the cementless UKA group (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis compared survival rates for aseptic loosening, implant revision (exchange of the femoral or tibial component), and any reoperation. Functional outcomes were assessed using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and the UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) Activity Score. At 50 months, cumulative survival rates showed no significant differences between cemented and cementless UKA for aseptic loosening (100 versus 97.7%; P = 0.35), implant revision (97.5 versus 93.3%; P = 0.36), or any reoperation (92.1 versus 87.0%; P = 0.35). There was one case of aseptic tibial subsidence that occurred in the cementless group in a patient who had femoral ON. Functional outcomes were excellent in both groups, with no significant differences in OKS (cemented/cementless: 42.6 ± 5.4 versus 43.5 ± 6.3; P = 0.12) or UCLA Activity Scores (6.1 ± 1.0 versus 6.1 ± 1.2; P = 0.57). Cementless medial mobile-bearing UKA is a safe treatment option for ON in the medial compartment, offering stable primary fixation and implant survival comparable to cemented fixation. However, future research with sex-balanced cohorts and extended follow-up is needed to confirm these findings.","Schweizer Conradin, Krug Tatjana, Herre Joachim, Aldinger Peter R, Merle Christian, Waldstein Wenzel",The Journal of arthroplasty,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40803564/,"Orthopaedic Clinic Paulinenhilfe, Diakonie-Klinikum, Stuttgart, Germany.; Orthopaedic Clinic Paulinenhilfe, Diakonie-Klinikum, Stuttgart, Germany; Center for Orthopaedics, Trauma Surgery and Rehabilitation Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany."
40776479,Risk Factors for Physiologic Radiolucent Lines Under the Tibial Base Plate After Osteoarthritis With Primary Computer-Assisted Navigation TKA-A Nested Case-Control Study.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease in the elderly population, and primary computer-assisted navigation total knee arthroplasty (CA-TKA) remains a critical therapeutic intervention for OA. The presence of physiologic radiolucent lines (RLLs) beneath the tibial base plate following CA-TKA carries significant long-term clinical implications and is regarded as a potential indicator of prosthetic loosening. However, the specific risk factors for RLL development in CA-TKA, despite its theoretical precision advantages, remain poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize the clinical features of physiologic RLLs and identify associated risk factors. A retrospective nested case-control study was conducted using a cohort of OA patients who underwent primary CA-TKA between January 2021 and September 2024. Physiologic RLLs were diagnosed according to the 1989 Knee Society Total Knee Arthroplasty Roentgenographic Evaluation and Scoring System. Patients with physiologic RLLs under the tibial base plate at follow-up were assigned to the RLLs group, while controls were matched 1:1 from the cohort based on follow-up time (±14 days). Covariates included age, gender, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, diabetes, surgical side, hospital stay duration, operative time, anesthesia type, continuous passive motion use, periprosthetic joint infection, total perioperative blood loss, preoperative/postoperative hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), tibial cement mantle quality, cement penetration, and perioperative medial proximal tibial angle. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors. The cohort comprised 407 patients, of whom 113 developed physiologic RLLs under the tibial base plate. Univariate analysis identified age, preoperative HKA, tibial cement mantle defects, and cement penetration as statistically significant risk factors (all p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that preoperative HKA (OR = 0.919, 95% CI = 0.876-0.963, p < 0.001), tibial cement mantle defects (OR = 2.638, 95% CI = 1.043-6.668, p = 0.040), and cement penetration (OR = 0.205, 95% CI = 0.126-0.332, p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for physiologic RLLs under the tibial base plate after primary CA-TKA in OA patients. Age was not an independent risk factor. The overall incidence and clinical characteristics of physiologic RLLs under the tibial base plate after primary CA-TKA were comparable to those reported for conventional TKA techniques. This nested case-control study identified preoperative HKA, tibial cement mantle defects, and cement penetration as independent risk factors for physiologic RLLs, whereas age was not.","Tian Hao, Ma Yang, Zhang Jinrui, Liu Enbo, Zhang Zhuo, Zuo Jianlin",Orthopaedic surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Case-Control Studies, Male, Female, Risk Factors, Retrospective Studies, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Aged, Surgery, Computer-Assisted, Middle Aged, Tibia, Postoperative Complications, Bone Plates, Prosthesis Failure",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40776479/,"Department of Orthopedics, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiographic results of primary TKA using a cementless, highly porous tibial baseplate with a minimum 10-year follow-up. This was a retrospective review of 300 consecutive, primary cementless TKAs using the same highly porous tibial baseplate. There were 35 patients (38 TKAs) deceased, 40 were lost to follow-up, and 10 patients had revisions, leaving 212 TKAs available for review. Outcome measures included range-of-motion (ROM), Knee Society score (KSS), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement score (KOOS JR), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System score (PROMIS-10), patient satisfaction, revision incidence, and radiographic findings. Mean KSS function and knee score improved from 45.3 and 40.4 preoperatively to 77.7 and 90.1 postoperatively (P ≤ 0.0001). Mean postoperative KOOS JR and FJS-12 scores were 86.5 and 83.7, respectively. Range of motion improved from a preoperative mean of 104.9 degrees of flexion and 2.3 degrees of extension to 119 degrees of flexion and 0 degrees of extension at 10 years (P ≤ 0.0001). Of the primary TKAs in the cohort, 97.5% were either very satisfied or satisfied. There were 10 revisions: one aseptic tibial loosening, four instabilities, two extensor mechanism ruptures, one chronic patella subluxation/arthrotomy rupture, one infection, and one for unexplained pain. Survivorship with all-cause failure as the endpoint at 10 years was 96.7% and 99.7% for aseptic loosening. Current-generation cementless TKA using a highly porous tibial baseplate with a keel and four pegs at a minimum 10-year follow-up provided effective pain relief, high patient satisfaction, and 96.7% survivorship.","Stoltz Michal J, Mullick Maunil, Smith Langan S, Duncan Anna E, Yakkanti Madhusudhan R, Malkani Arthur L",The Journal of arthroplasty,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40738233/,"University of Louisville, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, 550 S.

40729455,Migration of Cemented and Uncemented Implants in Total Knee Arthroplasty with an Asymmetrical Tibial Component: A Randomized Controlled Trial with a 2-Year Model-Based Radiostereometric Analysis Follow-up.,"Aseptic loosening remains a main complication following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), requiring revision surgery. Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) can assess the risk of aseptic loosening. This study evaluated the migration and segmental motion of cemented and uncemented femoral and asymmetrical tibial Persona components (Zimmer Biomet) with model-based RSA. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 63 patients (22 male patients and 41 female patients, with a mean age of 62 years) and compared patients who underwent TKA with cemented and uncemented Persona components. The primary outcome measure was the maximal total point motion (MTPM) after 2 years. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare groups. Migration was visualized by plotting the mean and 95% confidence interval (CI). After 3 months, femoral components demonstrated an MTPM of 0.41 mm (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.48 mm) in the cemented group and 0.65 mm (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.80 mm) in the uncemented group. Subsequently, a stabilization occurred, and the MTPM after 24 months was 0.51 mm (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.61 mm) in the cemented group and 0.83 mm (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.02 mm) in the uncemented group. There was a significant difference between fixation types at 3 months (p = 0.04), 6 months (p = 0.03), 12 months (p = 0.02), and 24 months (p = 0.02). At 3 months postoperatively, the tibial component demonstrated an MTPM of 0.70 mm (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.88 mm) in the cemented group and 0.76 mm (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.91 mm) in the uncemented group. A stabilization was then observed, and migration after 24 months was 0.72 mm (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.89 mm) for cemented components and 0.78 mm (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.92) for uncemented components. TKA with cemented and uncemented Persona components showed migration values within acceptable ranges, suggesting successful long-term fixation; however, significant differences in mean MTPM between cemented and uncemented femoral components were found.

40719149,Newer versus Older Implant Systems from a Single Manufacturer and Cause-Specific Revision Risk following Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Novel implant systems have design modifications that seek to improve total knee arthroplasty (TKA) survivorship. We evaluated overall and cause-specific revision risk for a newer generation implant system compared with its predecessor from the same manufacturer. We conducted a cohort study using data from the United States-based Kaiser Permanente Total Joint Replacement Registry. Adult patients who underwent primary, fully cemented, fixed-bearing TKA for osteoarthritis between 2009 and 2022 were identified. Only two implant systems from the manufacturer were included: the newer generation (<i>n</i> = 22,287) and the older generation (<i>n</i> = 37,105). Multivariable Cox regression was used to evaluate overall and cause-specific aseptic revision risk. In the adjusted analyses, no difference in risk was observed for the newer compared with older generation system in the first 4-year follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74-1.19); however, a higher risk was observed after 4-year follow-up (HR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.41-3.08). This higher risk was due to loosening (within 4 years: HR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.59-1.37; after 4 years: HR = 2.88, 95% CI = 1.84-4.51); no differences were observed for other revision reasons. When considering constructs utilizing different trays of the newer generation system, the higher risk of revision for loosening was observed only when the first iteration of the tray was used (HR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.37-2.77); no difference was observed for constructs utilizing the subsequent iterations of the tray, which underwent design changes, when compared with the older generation TKA system (HR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.20-1.01). We found no survivorship advantage with a newer TKA design compared with a preceding design from the same manufacturer. The higher risk of revision for loosening in the newer generation constructs was limited to those utilizing the first tray iteration, which is now discontinued by the manufacturer. The higher revision risk was not observed with subsequent iterations of the newer generation construct relative to the older generation.

40698895,"Association of tourniquet use on short-term implant survival after primary total knee arthroplasty: a study of 24,249 knees from the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register."," Tourniquet use in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) provides a bloodless surgical field, which may lead to a better cementation but reduced function and increased pain. We aimed to investigate the effect of a tourniquet during TKA on implant survival, implant loosening, infection, and mortality.  Data from 24,249 TKAs, collected by the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register between 2019 and 2023, was included. Among these, 14,926 were operated on with tourniquet and 9,323 without tourniquet. Cumulative revision rates (CRRs) were estimated using 1 minus Kaplan-Meier estimates for all revision causes and Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF) for specific revision causes at 3 years of follow-up. Cox regression analyses estimated hazard rate ratios (HRRs) for all revisions and Fine and Gray analyses estimated sub-hazard ratios (SHRs) for specific revision causes. Both were adjusted for age, sex, diagnosis, ASA score, fixation, implant type, and tranexamic acid use.  At 3 years of follow-up CRR was lower for the tourniquet group at 2.49% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.21-2.81) vs 3.59% (CI 3.14-4.10) for the non-tourniquet group. We found an increased risk of revision in the non-tourniquet group (HRR 1.81, CI 1.46-2.46) after 3 months. CIF demonstrated a lower CRR for aseptic tibial loosening for the tourniquet group (0.08%, CI 0.04-0.15) compared with the non-tourniquet group (0.39%, CI 0.25-0.58). There was a higher risk of aseptic tibial loosening for non-tourniquet TKAs (SHR 6.06, CI 3.06-12.00), but no association with aseptic femoral loosening. There was no difference in infection or mortality.  Tourniquet use during TKA was associated with reduced risk of tibial loosening after 3 years but without increased risk of infection, femoral loosening, or mortality.","Khan Michelle, Lygre Stein Håkon Låstad, Badawy Mona, Husby Otto Schnell, Hallan Geir, Høl Paul Johan, Gjertsen Jan-Erik, Furnes Ove",Acta orthopaedica,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Tourniquets, Male, Female, Norway, Aged, Registries, Prosthesis Failure, Reoperation, Middle Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Aged, 80 and over",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40698895/,"Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. michi.khan.mk@gmail.com.; The Norwegian Arthroplasty Register, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen; Department of Occupational Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; The Coastal Hospital at Hagevik, Hagevik, Norway.; Department of Neuromedicine and Movement Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Health Møre and Romsdal HF, Kristiansund Hospital, Kristiansund, Norway.; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen; The Norwegian Arthroplasty Register, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen; The Coastal Hospital at Hagevik, Hagevik, Norway.; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Biomatlab, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen; The Norwegian Arthroplasty Register, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway."
40687895,Patient-Specific Custom Patellofemoral Arthroplasty.,"Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) can be done with a number of devices that implement both inlay and onlay designs. Recent innovations in custom instrumentation allow for a new class of PFA that can precisely match the variable trochlear morphology. Patients with severe patellofemoral arthritis and preserved tibiofemoral joint space who had conservative treatment that has failed may benefit from PFA. A medial parapatellar arthrotomy of roughly 10 cm is used to evert the patella for visualization of the patellofemoral cartilaginous surfaces. An oscillating saw cut is performed while carefully preserving at least 12 mm of patellar bone. Three drill holes are made for future implantation of the patellar surface. Next, attention is turned to the trochlea, where any remaining cartilage is removed with a curette, with care taken not to remove any subchondral bone. A custom drill guide is then placed on the trochlea for 3 drill holes, followed by auxiliary holes with a drill bit for cement interdigitation. The wound is copiously irrigated and dried before cement is applied to the trochlea. The custom trochlear implant is carefully malleted in place, and excess cement is removed around the edges. Cement is then applied to the patella before similar implantation of the patellar implant. The medial parapatellar arthrotomy is then closed and a lateral lengthening is performed. Full range of motion is checked for appropriate patellar tracking. Implant survivorship is greater than 90% at 5 years and 83% at 10 years. With respect to patient-reported outcomes, Knee Society functional score improved from 49 to 89, and Knee Society objective score improved from 52 to 89. In a second study featuring 25 patients with a mean greater than 11 years of follow-up, no revisions were seen, with over 90% of patients able to return to sport. Utilizing the patient's native anatomy with a new, custom groove allows for improved, nonpathologic patellar tracking, especially in dysplastic cases, as seen in this case. This method for PFA holds the potential for improved patient satisfaction and advancement of patient-specific care in arthroplasty.

40659232,A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials on Contemporary Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"The number of total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) continues to grow, and there is a renewed, growing interest in cementless fixation. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating contemporary cementless TKA survivorship and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). A search of PubMed and Embase was performed. Inclusion criteria consisted of RCTs evaluating the survivorship and PROMs of contemporary cementless TKA published between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2024. Manuscripts written in languages other than English, retrospective reviews, case-control studies, and prospective cohort studies were excluded. A total of 27 studies met final inclusion. Modified Coleman methodology scoring and level of evidence were determined for all studies. Large database and registry studies were excluded given the low modified Coleman methodology scores, lack of long-term outcomes and control groups, and relatively small proportions (less than 5%) of cementless TKAs compared to cemented TKAs. The survivorship of contemporary cementless TKAs in the RCTs ranged from 93.7 to 100% at a mean follow-up of two to 17 years, and the survivorship of cemented TKAs ranged from 90 to 100% at the same mean follow-up. Of the 27 RCTs, 25 demonstrated at least equivalent survivorships for cementless versus cemented fixation. Of the 24 studies that evaluated PROMs, 20 studies demonstrated no substantial difference between groups, and four studies showed improved PROMs for cementless TKA. Based on the highest quality evidence, contemporary cementless TKA demonstrates similar levels of survivorship and PROMs compared to cemented TKA at a mean follow-up of two to 17 years.","Rainey Joshua P, Radtke Logan E, Lombardi Adolph V, Gililland Jeremy M, Mont Michael A",The Journal of arthroplasty,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40659232/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.; Joint Implant Surgeons, New Albany, Ohio.; Rubin Institute for Advanced Orthopedics, Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Baltimore, Maryland."
40634186,Bone cement implantation syndrome: a scoping review.,"Bone cement implantation syndrome comprises the occurrence of hypoxaemia, hypotension, unexpected loss of consciousness, or cardiac arrest occurring around the time of cementation, prosthesis insertion, or reduction of the joint in arthroplasty. As the yearly number of arthroplasties will increase, the number of complications including bone cement implantation syndrome is also expected to increase. Therefore, a good understanding of this syndrome is important. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge of bone cement implantation syndrome. This scoping review was conducted based on the PRISMA-ScR Checklist. A literature search was done in PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase. A total of 85 studies were included in the study. The incidence of bone cement implantation syndrome during cemented hip or knee arthroplasty varied from 15.4% to 46.7% and 27.5% to 70.7%, respectively. The incidence in shoulder arthroplasty was 16.2%. In uncemented hip arthroplasty, the incidence ranged from 0.0% to 21.8%. Risk factors identified for bone cement implantation syndrome included advanced age, ASA physical status 3 or 4, and primary lung cancer or lung metastasis. Bone cement implantation syndrome is a potentially severe complication that can occur during both cemented and uncemented arthroplasty. Moreover, the occurrence of bone cement implantation syndrome is not dependent on the use of cement. However, the severity does seem to have an association with the fixation method.","Brokke Karen E, Graman Manon, Servaas Sjoerd, Sierevelt Inger N, Steegers Monique A H, Nolte Peter A",British journal of anaesthesia,"Humans, Bone Cements, Syndrome, Risk Factors, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip, Postoperative Complications",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40634186/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Spaarne Gasthuis Academy, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands; Department of Anaesthesiology, Amsterdam Movement Sciences, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

40630819,Cemented Versus Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty: Analysis of the Latest Literature Data.,"The use of cementless total knee arthorplasty (TKA) has increased in recent years to the detriment of the use of cemented TKA. However, there is still no agreement on when to cement and in whom. A recent meta-analysis has shown that the cumulative survival at 12 years was 97% for the cementless implants and 89% for the cemented implants. Besides, no differences between the cemented and cementless TKAs were found in patient-reported results and revision rates. Another study showed noninferiority to cemented TKA. Its authors stated that cementles TKA can be utilized as an alternative mode of fixation in individuals opting for primary TKA. However, it was mentioned that additional long-run follow-up was required to confirm if cementless TKA can exhibit improved survivorship over cemented TKA. In individuals > 70 years of age, cementless TKA accomplished clinical scores equivalent to those of younger individuals at 2-year follow-up. Cementless TKA seemed to be a safe alternative for older individuals. Another meta-analysis has shown a substantial reduction in all-cause revisions and revisions for aseptic loosening when utilizing cementless fixation in high body mass index individuals when compared to the usage of cemented implants.

40622097,Robotic-assisted burr preparation significantly improves cement penetration but not immediate fixation strength in total knee arthroplasty.,"Although robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is recognized for improving surgical precision, the effect of its bone preparation technique on cemented fixation remains unclear. This study compared the impact of robotic-assisted burr versus oscillating saw techniques on cement penetration and fixation strength. Seven paired (n = 14) fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens underwent either robotic-assisted TKA using a burr system or conventional TKA using an oscillating saw. Computer tomography scans quantified cement penetration, while maximum failure load was determined using pull-out testing. Cement penetration was significantly greater in the burr group compared to the saw group (3.79 ± 0.84 cm³ vs. 2.67 ± 0.99 cm³, p = 0.03). The average pull-out strength for the burr group has no statistical difference compared with the saw group (2939 ± 760.9 N vs. 2372 ± 760.5 N, p = 0.16). Bone preparation using a burr technique significantly improves cement penetration compared to conventional oscillating saw technique. However, this did not translate to improved immediate fixation strength in time-zero biomechanical testing. Further clinical studies are needed to determine if enhanced cement penetration provides long-term benefits for implant survivorship.

40622067,Similar fixation of total knee arthroplasty components with medial congruent and cruciate retaining polyethylene inserts. A randomised double-blinded controlled radiostereometry trial with 24 months of follow-up.,"To assess the influence of a higher constraint medial congruent (MC) versus a cruciate retaining (CR) (gold standard) polyethylene insert on the migration of cemented tibial and femoral components of the Persona Total Knee System. High-constraint inserts may increase forces on components and potentially affect implant migration and long-term fixation. A cohort of 66 patients with primary knee osteoarthritis received a cemented Persona total knee arthroplasty and were randomised to either an MC or a CR polyethylene insert. Tibial and femoral component migration was assessed using static radiostereometric analysis, with the first stereo-radiograph taken supine on the first postoperative day (baseline) and again at 3-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up. Tibial and femoral component migration was evaluated in six degrees of freedom and as maximum total point motion (MTPM). At the 12-month follow-up, the mean difference in tibial component MTPM was 0.04 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.21 to 0.28).

40601967,"Prospective insights into tibial stems, cemented versus uncemented in primary total knee arthroplasty: A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry study.","The durability and effectiveness of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) depend on secure implant fixation and efficient bone integration. While cemented tibial components provide immediate mechanical stability, the addition of a short stem may be indicated in selected cases to enhance fixation. However, the stem does not allow for biological integration. The advantages of cementation over press-fit fixation remain a subject of debate, particularly regarding their impact on periprosthetic bone mineral density (BMD) over time. This study aims to compare periprosthetic BMD changes between cemented and noncemented tibial stems in primary TKA. In this prospective, monocentric study, we compared periprosthetic BMD changes in 60 patients undergoing primary TKA, randomised into two groups: 30 with cemented and 30 with noncemented tibial stems. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measured BMD preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively across six zones: beneath the tibial tray (R1, R2), around the stem (R3, R4), at the apex (R5), and a control zone below the stem (R6). Statistical analyses included repeated measures analysis of variance and independent t-tests. Cemented stems showed a significant increase in BMD at 12 months (+0.10 g/cm², p = 0.03) and 24 months (+0.12 g/cm², p = 0.04), outperforming noncemented stems (+0.06 g/cm², p = 0.12). Overall, cemented stems demonstrated greater BMD gains (+0.15 g/cm² vs. +0.08 g/cm², p = 0.03). Minimal changes were observed in both groups, with cemented stems showing slightly higher BMD retention (+0.05 g/cm² vs. -0.02 g/cm², p = 0.09). No statistically significant differences were recorded in certain regions. Cemented stems demonstrated greater periprosthetic BMD retention, which may contribute to improved mechanical environment for the implant. These findings may help guide the selection of fixation methods in primary TKA, particularly for patients with compromised bone quality.

40585594,A Case of Aseptic Loosening Secondary to Cement Debris.,"Particulate wear is a well-established cause of aseptic loosening and failure in joint arthroplasty. We aim to describe a case of cement-induced synovitis with the deposition of cement debris causing a distinct green-hued synovitis in a case of primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A 61-year-old lady presented to our clinic with right knee pain and swelling after undergoing bilateral total knee replacement four years ago at another institution. She was initially worked up by her primary surgeon and was symptomatically treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID). However, her symptoms persisted and impaired her daily function. She presented with right knee effusion and decreased range of motion of the knee, as well as joint line tenderness. Further radiological investigations showed right knee tibial component implant loosening, with bone cement fragments in the anterior tibia. As such, the patient was counselled and underwent a revision surgery. Intraoperatively, there was extensive synovitis with prominent green pigment deposits. Excessive cement was noted in the femoral notch, causing wear of the liner pole. The tibia tray was also found to be loose, with no cement adherent to the tibia tray, and all the cement mantle seated on the tibia bone. Postoperatively, the patient made an uneventful recovery. She was able to range her knee from 10-130 degrees with no pain within 2 months. Direct wear from residual cement and micromotion at the tibia tray due to poor cementing technique during the primary surgery were important factors leading to severe cement wear and failure. This clinical case is a reminder of the importance of good cementing technique to ensure a good outcome in TKA.","Gengatharan Dhivakaran, Chen Haobin, Lim Joel, Siow Wei Ming, Poon Kein Boon",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40585594/,"Orthopaedic Surgery, Sengkang General Hospital, Singapore, SGP."
40584683,Biomechanical Analysis of the Rebar Technique for Tibial Defects in Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Tibial defects in total knee arthroplasty require appropriate fixation for stability. Smaller defects are treated with cement or a screw and cement construct (rebar technique), while larger defects may require augments. Prior studies validate screws and cement for small defects but caution against use beyond 5 mm. This study compares the stiffness and subsidence of cement-only vs rebar techniques in larger contained and uncontained defects. Thirty-two proximal tibial composite bone analogs were divided into 2 groups: (1) Cemented and (2) Rebar, with subgroups for contained and uncontained defects (8 each). Tibial defects mimicked Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute Bone Defect Classification T1 and T2A classifications. Tibial baseplates were implanted using either cement alone or with a rebar technique (2 6.5 mm cancellous screws). Samples were mounted to a testing fixture simulating heel strike and underwent 10,000 cycles at 1 Hz. Tracking points were placed on each sample to measure displacement. Load and displacement data from the test frame were also collected. In the contained defect subgroup, rebar showed higher stiffness than cement alone, but the difference was not statistically significant (<i>P</i> = .349) and both groups had similar micromotion (<i>P</i> = .989). In uncontained defects, cement-only showed slightly higher stiffness than rebar (<i>P</i> = .655), with no statistical difference in micromotion (<i>P</i> = .893). Uncontained defects exhibited significantly more micromotion than contained defects (<i>P</i> = .0018, <i>P</i> = .0055). Rebar and cement-only techniques demonstrated similar biomechanical performance in tibial defects up to 1 cm. The cement and screw technique remains a viable option but may not be necessary in primary and revision total knee arthroplasty.","Moroze Sean P, Diaz Miguel A, Baione William, Ulrich Paul, Simon Peter, Lyons Steven T",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40584683/,"Florida Orthopaedic Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.; Foundation for Orthopaedic Research and Education, Tampa, FL, USA.; Lehigh Valley Health Network, Easton, PA, USA.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, FL, USA."

40560218,What is the influence of tibial component posterior slope on clinical and radiographic outcomes following cemented medial unicompartmental fixed-bearing knee arthroplasty? A retrospective study with a minimum follow-up of five years.,"To evaluate how changing the native posterior tibial slope (PTS) through implantation of a cemented medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) impacts clinical and radiographic outcomes, specifically whether it correlates with the occurrence of tibial periprosthetic radiolucency or tibial aseptic loosening (AL). This retrospective study analyzed 63 patients with cemented medial UKAs with a minimum follow-up of five years. Patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) included the Oxford Knee Score (OKS). Radiographic parameters assessed were: PTS, mechanical axis, prosthetic joint space height, tibial component obliquity, intraprosthetic divergence, and tibial periprosthetic radiolucency. Partial Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between tibial periprosthetic radiolucency and demographic or radiographic parameters. Of 63 patients (mean age 68.9 ± 7.9 years, follow-up 62.5 ± 8.8 months), 5 knees (7.9%) demonstrated tibial periprosthetic radiolucency ≥ 2 mm. The mean postoperative PTS change was 3.8 ± 2.6°, mechanical axis change: 2.5 ± 1.8°, prosthetic joint space height: 9.2 ± 3.1 mm, tibial component obliquity: 2.5° ± 3°, and intraprosthetic divergence angle: 5° ± 4°. OKS averaged 43.9 (range 22-48), with a mean knee flexion of 123.4 ± 6.8°. Statistical analysis showed no significant associations between tibial periprosthetic radiolucency and demographics, radiographic parameters, or PROMs. Changes in PTS did not correlate with a range of motion (ROM), PROMs, or radiolucency. In our cohort, the deviation from native PTS following implantation of the cemented tibial component did not show a significant correlation with tibial periprosthetic radiolucency, PROMs, or ROM at mid-term follow-up.","Polt Maksym, Thut Titus, Graf David Alexander, Helmy Naeder, Andronic Octavian",International orthopaedics,"Humans, Retrospective Studies, Aged, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Tibia, Radiography, Knee Joint, Prosthesis Failure, Treatment Outcome, Bone Cements, Prosthesis Design, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Range of Motion, Articular",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40560218/,"Balgrist University Hospital, Zürich, Switzerland.; Bürgerspital Solothurn, Solothurn, Switzerland.; Balgrist University Hospital, Zürich, Switzerland. octavian.andronic@balgrist.ch.; Bürgerspital Solothurn, Solothurn, Switzerland. octavian.andronic@balgrist.ch."

40519774,Global trends in fixation methods for primary total knee arthroplasty: An international registry-based analysis and review of outcomes.,"Despite the projected growth of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the United States (US) and worldwide, there remains debate regarding optimal implant fixation. The purpose of this study was to report the global trends in cementing rates for TKA using available data from national arthroplasty registries. Data were extracted from the annual reports of 7 national joint registries, with annual trends in cementation rates calculated via linear regression. Data regarding revision rates were aggregated from national joint registries, and a literature search identified all meta-analyses published since 2012 that compared outcomes of cemented and cementless fixation. Average rates of cementless fixation over the study period ranged from 1.4 % (Germany) to 15.4 % (Australia). The US led in cementless TKA usage with rates increasing at a rate of 2 % annually (<i>p</i><.001). In European countries, use of cementless fixation remains below 10 % with only Sweden showing increased adoption. Hybrid cementation is used <b>less than cemented or cementless</b> (<10 % of cases/year) in countries analyzed in this study except for Australia which reports upwards of 20 % of cases/year in 2022. Summary of meta-analyses revealed no clear differences in rates of revision, reoperation, infection, range of motion (ROM), or knee society score (KSS). The vast majority of TKAs performed worldwide use cement fixation, but rates of cemented and cementless TKA fixation vary widely by country. Recent meta-analyses generally indicate cementless TKA provides similar outcomes when compared to cemented TKA. In contrast, registry data still associates cemented TKAs with lower revision rates.","Lauck Bradley J, Larabee Landon, Morningstar Joshua L, Fraser James F",Journal of orthopaedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40519774/,"The University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America.; Department of Orthopaedics, The University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, United States of America.; Novant Health Orthopaedic & Sports Medicine Institute, Charlotte, NC, United States of America."
40514040,Comparative analysis of early radiolucencies in cementless versus cemented total knee arthroplasty.,"This study aimed to compare early outcomes of cemented and cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We analyzed 593 patients who underwent cemented or cementless TKA between January 2017 and December 2022. Data collected included demographics, BMI, comorbidities, surgical variables, follow-up duration, and outcomes such as implant survivorship, radiolucencies (assessed using the Modern Knee Society Radiographic Evaluation System (MKSRES)), short-term complications, revision rates, periprosthetic fractures, hospital length of stay, and readmissions. The study included 593 patients, equally divided into cemented and cementless groups. Age (p = 0.354) and sex (p = 0.342) were similar, though BMI was higher in the cementless group (p < 0.001). Comorbidities were comparable. Radiolucencies and osteolysis occurred in 12 cemented and ten cementless cases, with no significant differences across femoral and tibial zones (p ≥ 0.479). All radiolucencies were stable, partial, and non-progressive. No cases of aseptic loosening required revision. Revisions for periprosthetic fractures were rare (p = 0.218). Hospital length of stay (p = 0.623) and readmissions (p = 0.216) were similar between groups. The mean follow-up time postoperatively was slightly longer in the cementless group (4.22 years (SD 0.84)) compared to the cemented group (4.01 years (SD 1.03)) (p < 0.001). Cemented fixation remains the gold standard in TKA due to its reliability, yet advancements in implant design and indications support increasing adoption of cementless TKA. This study found comparable early outcomes for both methods, with stable radiolucent lines and no aseptic loosening during follow-up. The MKSRES facilitates standard radiological assessment, enabling precise implant monitoring and improving TKA outcome evaluation. These findings support the equivalence of cemented and cementless fixation in early survivorship.","Benkovich Vadim, Abialevich Artsiom, Osinsky Vladislav, Benkovich Guy",Bone & joint open,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40514040/,"Assuta Medical Center, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Soroka Medical Center, Beer Sheva, Israel.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.; Orthopedic Department, Sheba Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel."
40513774,Impaction bone grafting using fresh-frozen femoral head addressing severe bone defect in complex primary and revision TKA: A technical note.,"Severe tibial and/or femoral bone defects pose a significant challenge in both complex primary and revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Various techniques of reconstruction have been reported to address these defects, including adjustable augments, porous metal cones or sleeves, and the cement-and-screw technique. This technical note described the technique of impaction bone grafting (IBG), which involves using fresh-frozen femoral head allograft, that is structured or morselized and compacted into the femoral or tibial cavitary defect, followed by cementation of stemmed TKA implant. Although IBG is poorly documented in the literature and has been predominantly utilized in revision TKA, we presented its application in three cases: one complex primary TKA and two revision TKA (one involving tibial reconstruction and the other femoral reconstruction). Our report highlighted the effectiveness of IBG for both tibial and femoral reconstruction, with clinical and radiographic evidence confirming successful osseointegration at the 5-year follow-up. Therefore, IBG may be a viable technique for managing severe bone defects in both complex primary and revision TKA.

40505751,Cemented Versus Press-Fit Patellar Implants in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Modern press-fit patellar components (PFP) for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are becoming more popular as the technology has improved, and studies have shown comparable survivorship with potential advantages such as decreased operative time and biologic fixation. However, there is a paucity of large, high-quality studies comparing survivorship and failure rates of PFP versus cemented patellar components (CPs). The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the survivability of CP compared to PFP components in terms of all-cause, aseptic loosening, and patellar fracture failure in primary TKA. We hypothesized that these operative modalities would have similar survivorship. A systematic review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for PubMed and EMBASE databases. Case reports, review articles, < years years of follow-up, and studies involving revision arthroplasty were excluded. T-tests evaluated differences in age, body mass index, sex, and Knee Society Score between PFP and CP in primary TKA. Relative risk ratios were calculated to examine possible significant differences in survivorship between press-fit versus CP modalities. A total of 25 studies (31,757 knees) met the inclusion criteria. These articles were published between 1991 and 2024 and included 3,385 PFPs and 28,372 CPs. The mean follow-up time, age, and body mass index were 8.4 years, 65 years, and 31.0, respectively. Patients receiving CP and PFP differed only in age (67 years versus 63 years, P = 0.013). There was no difference in survivability between PFP and CP for either aseptic loosening, patellar fracture, or all-cause failure as end points (all-cause failure, two-arm analysis P = 0.20). Modern PFPs have similar survivorship when compared to CP designs. However, there are few high-level studies investigating PFP. Future prospective, randomized trials should be conducted to further examine survivorship, risk of adverse events, and outcomes between PFP and CP.","Van Steyn Peter M, Porter Kimberton K, Henry Antonio A, Ridgewell Caitlin, Formby Peter M",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Patella, Prosthesis Failure, Prosthesis Design, Bone Cements, Aged, Male, Female, Middle Aged",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40505751/,"Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Liberty, North Carolina.; Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Suwanee, Georgia.; Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."
40480332,Influence of Implant Design on Failure Rates in Medial Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: A Meta-Analysis.,"Medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (MUKA) has become an established treatment option for medial compartment osteoarthritis. While advancements in materials and robotic-assisted surgery have improved outcomes, concerns about long-term survivorship persist. This systematic review and meta-analysis assess failure rates of MUKA based on implant designs, follow-up periods, and surgical techniques. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews (ID CRD42023479247). Literature searches in PubMed, Cochrane, MEDLINE, and EMBASE included studies from 2016 to 2024. Inclusion criteria were English-language studies reporting MUKA survivorship and failure rates, with a minimum cohort of 20 patients, specifying implant type and surgical technique. Data extraction and analysis were performed by three independent reviewers. Statistical analyses used the Mantel-Haenszel method and random-effects models. From 159 articles, failure rates across 114,088 knees were 2.7% (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 3.3). Failure rates were 6.3% for fixed bearing all-polyethylene, 1.3% for fixed bearing metal-backed (FB M-B), and 3.0% for mobile bearing metal-backed (MB M-B). Significant differences were noted between fixed bearing all-polyethylene and both FB M-B (P = 0.004) and MB M-B (P = 0.007), but not between FB M-B and MB M-B (P = 0.12). By follow-up duration, failure rates were 0.4% for <5 years, 4.1% for 5 to 10 years, and 8.3% for > 10 years. Robotic techniques had significantly lower failure rates than standard techniques (1.2 versus 2.9%, P = 0.001). This meta-analysis demonstrates that advanced implant designs improve outcomes for MUKA, while robotic techniques further enhance results. However, variability in survivorship definition, follow-up duration, and lack of differentiation between cemented and uncemented implants remain limitations. Future studies should explore long-term outcomes, refine implant choices, and optimize surgical approaches to enhance MUKA survivorship.","Fratini Stefano, Cerasoli Tosca, Meena Amit, Di Paolo Stefano, Bonaiuti Margherita, Romagnoli Matteo, Zaffagnini Stefano, Marcheggiani Muccioli Giulio Maria",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Failure, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Prosthesis Design, Osteoarthritis, Knee",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40480332/,"Dipartimentimento Rizzoli-Argenta, IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Argenta, Italy.; II Clinica Ortopedica, IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.; Division of Orthopedic, Shalby Multi-Speciality Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.; II Clinica Ortopedica, IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy; Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy."
40476212,Comparison of Cement Penetration and Clinical Outcomes in Total Knee Arthroplasty: High-Viscosity vs Low-Viscosity Cement.,"This retrospective study compared cement penetration, the radiolucent line (RLL) incidence, and clinical outcomes in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using high-viscosity cement (HVC) versus low-viscosity cement (LVC) with a minimum follow-up of two years. We hypothesized that LVC would result in superior cement penetration and a reduced RLL incidence compared with HVC without differences in clinical outcomes. A total of 100 patients (50 HVC, 50 LVC) who underwent TKA with the same implant design were included. Cement penetration was assessed in four tibial and two femoral zones. Clinical outcomes including the VAS, WOMAC, KSS, KOOS and FJS were evaluated preoperatively and at the final follow-up visit. Postoperative complications were recorded. LVC demonstrated significantly greater cement penetration in the posterior tibial zone (3.03 mm vs. vs 2.82 mm; p=0.005) and posterior femoral zone (1.76 mm vs. 1.39 mm; p<0.000) than HVC, and no differences were observed in other zones. The RLL incidence and rates of complications including aseptic loosening and prosthetic joint infection were comparable between groups. Both groups showed significant postoperative improvements in the WOMAC, KSS, and KOOS, with no intergroup differences preoperatively and postoperatively. LVC demonstrated superior cement penetration in select zones, which may enhance implant fixation. However, there were no differences in the RLL incidence or clinical outcomes between the HVC and LVC groups. Both cements provided satisfactory fixation and clinical results, suggesting that either may be appropriate based on surgical preferences and fixation goals.","Yang Hong-Yeol, Cheon Jae-Hyeok, Zheng Youzhen, Seon Jong-Keun",Chonnam medical journal,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40476212/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Center for Joint Disease, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea."
40457482,Customized 3D-Printed Resurfacing Arthroplasty for the Treatment of Severely Malunited Distal Humerus Associated With Posttraumatic Elbow Stiffness: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"Posttraumatic elbow stiffness together with severe bony deformity of the distal humerus poses a great challenge for elbow surgery specialists. For young and high-demand patients suffering from grievous bony deformity but with no/mild joint degeneration, total elbow arthroplasty is not a suitable option, and hemiarthroplasty often results in a significant amount of bone stock loss, making it difficult to perform a revision procedure. Resurfacing arthroplasty has been applied in the shoulder, hip, and knee joints, as well as the radiocapitellar joint. However, resurfacing arthroplasty for the entire distal humeral articular surface was not available among current clinical studies. We report a case of a 66-year-old male patient who presented with elbow stiffness and grievous malunion of the distal humerus due to delayed treatment after a distal humerus fracture. However, there was only mild joint degeneration observed at the proximal ulna and radius owing to long-term functional impairment. Total elbow replacement was not suitable considering certain inevitable manual labor he must attend. We customized a cementless and stemless resurfacing prosthesis for the distal humerus based on contralateral articular anatomy using a 3D-printing technique with Co-Cr-Mo alloy. The traditional cemented stem was replaced with criss-cross screws to provide primary stability. The bone-implant interface was covered with a 3D-printed trabecular-like porous structure for bone in-growth and several grooves designed for bone grafting, eventually forming a stable multinested mortise-and-tenon joint structure at the bone-implant interface. At the last follow-up, significant improvements in functional outcomes of the elbow joint were observed without any prosthesis-related complications. The patient was able to return to his previous manual labor and reported improved weight-bearing capability of the affected upper limb up to 25 kg without pain or instability. While he complained of postoperative ulnar nerve palsy, the symptom markedly improved at the final follow-up. The novel prosthesis we have designed for resurfacing arthroplasty of the distal humerus can provide adequate primary stability and bone in-growth capability, making it a reliable alternative for patients with severe bony deformity of the distal humerus and no/mild joint degeneration at the proximal ulna and radius, particularly young patients or those with high functional demands.","Hua Kehan, Zhang Jianyu, Gong Maoqi, Zha Yejun, Jiang Xieyuan",Orthopaedic surgery,"Humans, Male, Aged, Humeral Fractures, Elbow Joint, Printing, Three-Dimensional, Fractures, Malunited, Prosthesis Design, Elbow Injuries, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Elbow, Hemiarthroplasty",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40457482/,"Department of Orthopedic Trauma, Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."
40449555,Total hip arthroplasty in patients with angular proximal femoral deformities.,"An angular proximal femoral deformity, in association with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip, considerably increases the technical complexity of primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). The aims of this study were to determine the long-term implant survival, the risk factors for failure, complications, and clinical outcomes of contemporary primary THA in this difficult group of patients. Our institutional total joint registry was used to identify 119 primary THAs performed in 108 patients with an angular proximal femoral deformity, between January 1997 and September 2017. The deformity was related to a previous femoral osteotomy in 102 THAs (86%), and developmental or metabolic disorders in 17 THAs (14%). A total of 62 hips (53%) had a predominantly varus deformity. The mean age of the patients was 44 years (SD 13), their mean BMI was 29 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD 6), and 70 (59%) were female. An uncemented femoral component with metaphyseal fixation was used in 35 THAs (30%), an uncemented femoral component with diaphyseal fixation in 34 (29%), an uncemented modular femoral component with a metaphyseal fixation sleeve in 29 (24%), and a cemented femoral component in 21 (18%). Simultaneous corrective femoral osteotomy was performed in 22 THAs (18%). Kaplan-Meier survival and Harris Hip Scores (HHSs) were reported. The mean follow-up was eight years (2 to 22). The ten-year survival free of femoral loosening, any femoral revision, any revision and any reoperation was 95%, 93%, 90%, and 88%, respectively. A total of 13 revisions were undertaken, for aseptic femoral loosening in three, fracture of the femoral component in two, dislocation in two, aseptic acetabular loosening in two, polyethylene liner exchange in two, and infection in two. A preoperative varus deformity was associated with a higher risk of any revision (hazard ratio (HR) 12.5, p = 0.020), and those with a simultaneous osteotomy had a higher risk of any reoperation (HR 3.6, p = 0.023). The mean HHSs improved significantly from 52 preoperatively to 82 at ten years (p < 0.001). In the largest series to date of primary THAs in patients with hip OA and an angular proximal femoral deformity, we found a good ten-year survival free from any revision. Varus deformities, particularly those treated with a simultaneous osteotomy due to the magnitude or location of the deformity, had a higher rate of further surgery.","Dagneaux Louis, Abdel Matthew P, Sierra Rafael J, Lewallen David G, Trousdale Robert T, Berry Daniel J",The bone & joint journal,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip, Female, Male, Adult, Middle Aged, Osteoarthritis, Hip, Prosthesis Failure, Femur, Hip Prosthesis, Retrospective Studies, Reoperation, Osteotomy, Risk Factors, Registries, Aged, Postoperative Complications, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40449555/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA."
40425947,Enhanced improvement and comparable survivorship in cementless versus cemented total knee arthroplasty: a 2-year analysis of patient reported outcomes and 5-year analysis of implant survivorship.,"This study aimed to evaluate patient-reported outcomes, functional recovery, satisfaction, and implant survivorship for cementless and cemented TKA. A prospective, non-randomized, multicenter study was conducted on 453 patients. Cohort 1 (n = 373 knees) received a fully cementless construct with the Triathlon Tritanium Tibial Baseplate, Triathlon Tritanium Patella, Triathlon CR or PS Beaded Femur with Peri-Apatite, and the Triathlon Tibial Insert. Cohort 2 (n = 147 knees) received a fully cemented construct with identical implant design. Oxford Knee Score (OKS), 2011 Knee Society Score (KSS), and Short Form 12 scores were recorded preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Implant survivorship and adverse events were also recorded. OKS (mean difference [MD] 1.5, p = 0.0123), KSS Symptoms for pain (with level walking [MD 0.62, p = 0.0007]; with stairs or incline [MD 0.85, p = 0.0037), KSS Patient satisfaction (MD 2.31, p = 0.0004), and KSS Functional Activities (MD 0.53, p = 0.0108) were significantly greater in Cohort 1 out to 2 years postoperatively. The Kaplan-Meier estimated all-cause survivorship was 98.2% (95% CI: 95.7-99.3%) for Cohort 1 and 97.5% (95% CI: 92.6-99.2%) for Cohort 2 (p = 0.4366). Cementless TKA exhibited similar or greater patient outcomes, satisfaction, and function up to 2 years postoperative, while both cohorts showed comparable rates of adverse events and survivorship at 5-year follow-up.

40421867,Cementless versus cemented fixation in image-based robotic total knee arthroplasty guided by functional knee positioning principles.,"Under functional knee positioning (FKPos) principles, residual varus or valgus alignment of the tibia and femur may be maintained, resulting in loading conditions that differ from those observed with mechanical alignment. Consequently, there is a need for evidence regarding implant fixation (cemented or cementless) in this context. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of implant fixation type (cemented versus cementless) on clinical outcomes, complications, and implant survival in robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) guided by FKPos principles. A retrospective comparative analysis of 393 patients who underwent robotic-assisted primary TKA was performed. Patients were divided into two groups: cemented (n = 85) and cementless (n =276) fixation. Radiographic alignment, functional outcomes using the Knee Society Score (KSS) and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), complication rates, and implant survival were assessed at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Subgroup analyses based on femoral and tibial fixation types were also conducted. Both fixation methods achieved comparable functional outcomes (KSS and FJS) and implant survivorship, with no significant differences in revision rates. Hematomas were significantly more frequent in the cementless group (12.32% vs. 8.24%, p = 0.02). Subgroup analyses of femoral and tibial implants showed no significant differences in functional outcomes. This study is the first to assess the influence of fixation type on outcomes in robotic-assisted TKA performed under FKPos principles. Both cemented and cementless fixation methods are safe and effective.","Koutserimpas Christos, Gregori Pietro, Veizi Enejd, Andriollo Luca, Servien Elvire, Batailler Cécile, Lustig Sébastien",SICOT-J,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40421867/,"Orthopaedics Surgery and Sports Medicine Department, FIFA Medical Center of Excellence, Croix-Rousse Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon University Hospital, 103 Grande Rue de la Croix-Rousse, 69004 Lyon, France - School of Rehabilitation Health Sciences, University of Patras, Campus of University of Patras, Rio, 26504, Patras, Greece.; Orthopaedics Surgery and Sports Medicine Department, FIFA Medical Center of Excellence, Croix-Rousse Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon University Hospital, 103 Grande Rue de la Croix-Rousse, 69004 Lyon, France - Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico, Via Alvaro del Portillo, 200, 00128, Roma, Italy.; Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University, Ankara Bilkent City Hospital, Üniversiteler, 1604, 06800, Ankara, Turkey.; Orthopaedics Surgery and Sports Medicine Department, FIFA Medical Center of Excellence, Croix-Rousse Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon University Hospital, 103 Grande Rue de la Croix-Rousse, 69004 Lyon, France - Ortopedia e Traumatologia, Fondazione Poliambulanza, Via Leonida Bissolati, 57, 25124 Brescia, Italy.; Orthopaedics Surgery and Sports Medicine Department, FIFA Medical Center of Excellence, Croix-Rousse Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon University Hospital, 103 Grande Rue de la Croix-Rousse, 69004 Lyon, France - LIBM-EA 7424, Interuniversity Laboratory of Biology of Mobility, Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, 43 Bd du 11 Novembre 1918, 69100 Villeurbanne, Lyon, France.; Orthopaedics Surgery and Sports Medicine Department, FIFA Medical Center of Excellence, Croix-Rousse Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon University Hospital, 103 Grande Rue de la Croix-Rousse, 69004 Lyon, France - Univ Lyon, Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, IFSTTAR, LBMC UMR_T9406, 25 Avenue François Mitterand, 69622 Lyon, France."
40421410,"Total knee arthroplasty revision risks depending on the bone cement used-Data from 50,545 knee replacements of the Catalan Arthroplasty Registry.","Clinical data on individual bone cement brands and viscosities in cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is scarce. The Catalan arthroplasty registry (RACat) documents usage of cement brands including viscosities and the inclusion of antibiotics. The objective was to compare the clinical performance of the widely used bone cement brand PALACOS® to other blinded bone cement brands in TKA using data from the RACat. Patient data on 50,545 primary TKA between 2007 and 2017 in the RACat were analysed retrospectively. Implant survival of PALACOS bone cement was compared to other blinded bone cement brand groups using the all-cause revision risk as primary study endpoint. Comparing implant survival, it was found that (1) PALACOS® (with or without gentamicin) was associated with a significantly lower revision risk compared to other cement brands (with or without antibiotics) (<i>p</i> = 0.001): RR PALACOS 2.03% versus RR other brands 3.88%, and RR PALACOS+G 1.84% versus RR other antibiotic-loaded bone cements (ALBC) 3.85%; (2) ALBC (all brands) did not reduce the risk of revisions (<i>p</i> = n.s) compared to plain bone cements (PBC); and (3) the medium viscosity PALACOS MV+G showed the lowest reoperation risk versus other ALBC (all viscosities): RR 1.12% versus RR 3.85%. Competing-risk regression models confirmed reduction in revision risk for all PALACOS compared with other brands (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and for PALACOS+G compared with other ALBC (<i>p</i> < 0.001) but showed no difference when comparing all ALBC with all PBC (<i>p</i> = 0.403). Comparing PALACOS MV+G with all other ALBC showed reduction of revision risk (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and no difference when comparing PALACOS medium viscosity (MV) with all other PBC (<i>p</i> = 0.108). Type of cement brand, viscosity and the addition of antibiotics have an impact on revision risk of TKA. Medium viscosity cement with gentamicin (PALACOS MV+G), for which no clinical data were previously available, was associated with the lowest revision risk in TKA.

40417798,Cemented mobile-bearing medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty provides long-term implant survival and sustained functional performance in young and active patients aged 60 or below.,"To evaluate long-term outcomes of cemented, mobile-bearing medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) in patients aged 60 or younger, focusing on implant survival, functional results, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and radiographic findings over >10 years. This retrospective single-centre study included 119 knees (102 patients). Implant survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. PROMs included the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), American Knee Society Score (AKSS), UCLA Activity Score and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Assessments were performed preoperatively, at mid-term (2-10 years), and at long-term follow-up (>10 years). OKS and AKSS were analysed in relation to Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) thresholds. Radiographs were graded using the Kellgren-Lawrence classification to evaluate lateral osteoarthritis (LOA) progression. The implant survival rate was 86.7% (95% CI: 78.5-91.9%) at 15 years, and 81.7% (95% CI: 71.4%-88.5%) at 17.5 years. Revision surgery was required in 18 knees (mean time to revision: 8.7 years), primarily due to progression of LOA. All PROMs improved significantly from baseline to the final follow-up (mean: 16 years; p < 0.0001). Although minor functional declines occurred between mid- and long-term follow-ups, these were not statistically significant (p > 0.05), except for functional AKSS. At the final assessment, 96% of patients exceeded the PASS threshold for OKS, 84% for AKSS objective, and 80% for AKSS functional scores. Radiographic LOA progression was frequent but did not significantly impair functional outcomes. Cemented mobile-bearing medial UKA in patients aged ≤60 years demonstrated high long-term implant survival and sustained functional benefit. Even in the presence of radiographic LOA progression, clinical outcomes remained excellent. UKA represents a durable and effective treatment for younger patients with isolated medial compartment osteoarthritis.

40414376,Double DAIR Protocol for Acute Periprosthetic Joint Infection: A 15-Year Institutional Experience.,"Recently, the double debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) using antibiotic-loaded bone cement beads for the treatment of acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) has gained traction following promising reports in the literature. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical outcomes of this protocol and identify predictors of failure following completion of a double DAIR procedure. This retrospective study identified all patients who underwent a double DAIR protocol for the management of acute PJI (≤ 28 days from either index arthroplasty or symptom onset) at a single institution. Acute PJI was defined using the 2013 Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria. All patients had a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Treatment failure was defined as reoperation secondary to infection, PJI-related mortality, or signs of persistent infection at the latest follow-up. There were 128 patients (69 knees and 59 hips) included in the final analyses. At a mean follow-up time of 4.8 ± 3.9 years, 86.1% of infected primaries and 71.4% of infected revision patients were found to have experienced treatment success. When adjusting for covariates, multivariate regression analyses identified revision arthroplasty (odds ratio [OR], 7.6; P = 0.002), acute hematogenous PJI (OR, 7.1; P = 0.048), and positive culture at second debridement (OR, 5.0; P = 0.039) as independent predictors of failure following completion of a double DAIR procedure. We found that 86.1% of infected primaries and 71.4% of infected revisions that received a double DAIR for acute PJI were infection-free at the latest follow-up. On regression analyses, revision arthroplasty, acute hematogenous PJI, and a positive culture at second debridement were found to be independent predictors of treatment failure in this patient population.","Tarabichi Saad, Verhey Jens T, Haglin Jack M, Horne Carly, Deckey David G, Clarke Henry D, Bingham Joshua S, Spangehl Mark J",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Prosthesis-Related Infections, Retrospective Studies, Female, Male, Debridement, Aged, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Middle Aged, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Reoperation, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip, Knee Prosthesis, Bone Cements, Aged, 80 and over, Hip Prosthesis, Treatment Outcome, Acute Disease, Follow-Up Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40414376/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona."

A methodology for more accurate cost accounting is time-driven activity-based costing. No prior study has evaluated the value of cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using time-driven activity-based costing. We performed a retrospective propensity score-matched analysis of 76 cementless TKAs and 304 cemented TKAs with a mean follow-up of 4.3 years (range, 1.7 to 8.5). Reference pricing for implants was used, and cementless implants were available at a premium price relative to reference pricing. Value was the primary outcome and was defined twofold: Absolute Value <sub>KOOS-PS</sub> was the quotient of 1-year Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function Short-Form (KOOS-PS) and facility cost; Incremental Value <sub>KOOS-PS</sub> was the quotient of delta KOOS-PS and facility cost. Revision rate was also compared but not factored into our value equation. Cementless TKAs had significantly higher total facility costs than cemented TKAs (971 versus 800 cost units; percent difference: +21.4%; P < 0.001). The cost difference was principally related to cementless TKAs having higher implant costs (542 versus 367 cost units; percent difference: +47.7%; P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in KOOS-PS scores. Cementless TKA was found to have significantly reduced mean Absolute Value <sub>KOOS-PS</sub> (48.3 versus 58.1; P < 0.001) and Incremental Value <sub>KOOS-PS</sub> (16.5 versus 20.3; P = 0.038). The revision rate at the mean 4.3-year follow-up was low and similar (3.9 versus 2.3%; P = 0.42). We compared value (defined as 1-year patient-reported outcome measures relative to facility costs) between cementless and cemented TKA. Cementless TKAs demonstrate lower value at a mean 4.3-year follow-up due to differences in implant cost. Increased value for cementless TKA is ultimately plausible if reductions in revision rates beyond 5-year follow-up are observed or if cementless TKA implants are incorporated in reference pricing matrices to reduce their cost.","Peterson Shian L, Sauder Nicholas, Meghpara Michael M, Lim Perry L, Melnic Christopher M, Bedair Hany S",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Female, Male, Retrospective Studies, Aged, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Propensity Score, Reoperation, Follow-Up Studies, Middle Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Bone Cements, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Aged, 80 and over, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40414369/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Newton-Wellesley Hospital, Newton, Massachusetts."

Database search was conducted on MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and CINAHL for studies analyzing bone remodelling after joint replacement (March 2002-January 2024). Inclusion criteria: English-language articles; total joint replacement; at least two BMD evaluations; observational studies, cross-sectional, prospective, retrospective, randomised controlled trials, and clinical trials. Exclusion criteria: no BMD measurement within one month after surgery; BMD data only expressed as percentage changes or graphs without numerical values; no Gruen zone evaluation for hip replacement; no periprosthetic bone evaluation for knee replacement; pharmacological treatment or comorbidities affecting BMD; revision joint replacements; irrelevant articles; no full text or no original data. Sixty-eight articles matched the selection criteria. Fifty-five focused on the hip joint, 12 on the knee, and one on the shoulder. After total hip arthroplasty, the greatest bone resorption occurred in the proximal femur, peaking at 6 months. Cemented implants and tapered stems showed greater bone resorption than cementless implants and anatomical stems. BMD around the acetabular component decreased during the first 6 months but increased in regions subjected to higher loads. In total knee arthroplasty, bone loss occurred in the anterior distal femur and medial tibial plateau, with cemented and posterior-stabilised implants showing greater bone loss than cementless and cruciate-retaining designs. The periprosthetic BMD decreases progressively after joint replacement. The fixation technique and implant design influence the extent and pattern of this decline. These factors must be considered during the surgical planning, as they can have long-term implications for bone health and implant longevity. Further research is needed to optimise implant design and surgical techniques to mitigate BMD loss and improve patient outcomes.

40373833,Outcomes of Primary Cementless Femoral Stems Used in Revision Hip Arthroplasty.,"An abundance of literature exists assessing outcomes of revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) using diaphyseal-engaging stems; however, there is little research into the use of primary-style femoral stems in revision THA. Primary stems may have benefits, including cost reduction, maintenance of proximal bone stock, and ease of potential future reconstructions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the aseptic survival rate of revision THAs using primary femoral stems. A review of our registry was performed to identify patients from 2010 to 2020 who underwent all-cause revision THA utilizing a primary metaphyseal-engaging stem for femoral reconstruction. Patients who had a history of previous revision THA or those treated with cement or bone graft augmentation were excluded. There were seven patients excluded due to a lack of 2-year follow-up. Implant survival, complications requiring revision surgery, and ambulatory status at final follow-up were documented. There were 78 patients who met the final inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 2.0 to 10.0). The most common indications for index revision were aseptic loosening (44%) or infection (34%). Prerevision Paprosky classification of the femur was Type I in 41 patients (52%), Type II in 37 patients (47%), and Type IIIA in one patient (1%). Overall, 13 patients (16.5%) required rerevision, five for periprosthetic fracture, six for instability, and two for recurrent infection. Of those, seven of 13 required femoral component revision. When excluding recurrent infections, the aseptic femoral component survivorship for the cohort was 94%. There were three patients who sustained a fracture requiring stem rerevision. A Vancouver B1 fracture was sustained > 2 years postoperatively, and two Vancouver B2 fractures were sustained within 6 months postoperatively. There were no femoral rerevisions for aseptic loosening. Primary metaphyseal-engaging femoral stems provide reliable fixation during revision THA in patients who have preserved proximal metaphyseal bone, with similar complication rates to those previously reported in the literature for revision THA.","Dombrowsky Alex R, Jolissaint Josef E, Avercamp Ben J, Rowe Taylor M, Hietpas Kayla T, Griffin William L, Curtin Brian M",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip, Reoperation, Male, Female, Middle Aged, Aged, Hip Prosthesis, Prosthesis Failure, Prosthesis Design, Adult, Aged, 80 and over, Femur, Treatment Outcome, Registries, Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40373833/,"Department of Orthopedics, Atrium Health Musculoskeletal Institute, Charlotte, North Carolina.; OrthoCarolina Research Institute, Charlotte, North Carolina.; OrthoCarolina Hip and Knee Center, Charlotte, North Carolina.; Department of Orthopedics, Atrium Health Musculoskeletal Institute, Charlotte, North Carolina; OrthoCarolina Hip and Knee Center, Charlotte, North Carolina."
40364164,Long-Term Outcomes of Cementless Versus Hybrid Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Minimum 10-Year Follow-Up.,"<b>Background</b>: Although cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is considered the standard fixation technique, the emerging trend toward cementless fixation has created the need for a detailed comparison. In a previous study, we reported the 5-year results comparing cementless and hybrid cemented TKAs using the same implant design. The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term follow-up at a minimum of 10 years. <b>Methods</b>: A retrospective analysis was performed on 120 TKAs (60 cementless, 60 hybrid cemented) conducted between 2003 and 2007 using the e.motion posterior cruciate-retaining knee prosthesis with a floating-platform mobile polyethylene bearing (Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany). Demographic and clinical data were collected; radiographic follow-up was performed with attention to signs of loosening, while complications and revision surgery were assessed using competing risk analysis. Operative time was recorded as an indicator of surgical efficiency. <b>Results</b>: At 10 years, 59 TKAs (54 patients) were available for long-term follow-up. Both fixation groups demonstrated significant improvement in Knee Society Scores (KSSs) compared to preoperative values (<i>p</i> < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in KSSs between the two groups at 10 years follow-up (<i>p</i> = 0.480). The 10-year cumulative incidence of revision was 8.4% in both groups (<i>p</i> = 0.721), and that of aseptic loosening was identical at 3.4% (<i>p</i> = 0.967). Although radiolucent lines were noted in three tibial components of the cementless group, the difference was not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.075). Notably, the cementless group demonstrated a significantly shorter operative time with a mean difference of 10 min (<i>p</i> = 0.017). <b>Conclusions</b>: At a minimum follow-up of 10 years, there were no significant differences between the hybrid cemented and cementless groups in revision rates, cumulative incidences, clinical scores, or radiological signs of loosening, confirming the long-term effectiveness of both fixation methods in clinical practice.","Rabitsch Lukas, Vertesich Klemens, Giurea Alexander, Windhager Reinhard, Lass Richard",Journal of clinical medicine,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40364164/,"Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 23, 1090 Vienna, Austria."
40359142,The Effect of the Design of Polyethylene Inserts in Total Knee Arthroplasty on Patient Reported Outcomes.,"Several types of polyethylene liners have been developed to address the specific needs of patients' anatomy within total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In modern TKA, the posterior-stabilized (PS) and the cruciate-retaining (CR) designs are the most common, with the medial congruent (MC) design becoming more popular. The MC total knee arthroplasty has a posterior dwell point allowing for more flexion. The purpose of this study was to determine differences in patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) or postoperative outcomes between these three TKAs. Patients who underwent a primary, elective, unilateral TKA between June 2021 and July 2023 were identified. Demographics and perioperative and postoperative outcomes were extracted from the medical record. PROMs from 624 patients were obtained through a digital engagement platform. A P value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Patients were subdivided into three groups; 111 PS-TKA, 278 CR-TKA, and 235 MC-TKAs. Most implants were Zimmer (71.5%) and were cemented (92.9%). Patients in the CR group were predominantly male (P = 0.003) and had a lower body mass index (P < 0.001). No differences were seen in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement scores at any time point (preoperative: P = 0.073; 12 weeks: P = 0.144; 6 months: P = 0.666; 1 year: P = 0.622). A similar percentage of patients met the minimal clinically important difference (P = 0.480), and Forgotten Joint Scores were equivalent (P = 0.930). Patient physical therapy parameters (Timed Up and Go test [P = 0.779] and ambulation distance [P = 0.103]), inpatient pain levels (at rest: P = 0.101, with activity: P = 0.052), or morphine milligram equivalents dosed (P = 0.608) were comparable. No differences were seen in 30-day complications. This study fails to demonstrate a difference in PROMs, functional parameters, or complications between the PS-TKAs, CR-TKAs, and MC-TKAs. All three constructs perform similarly in the immediate postoperative period. Because equivalent outcomes occur with each polyethylene, implant choice should be left to physician preference.","Gunda Bhavana, Goldberg Leah, Alban Angie, Strecker Sara, McCracken Caitlin, Carangelo Robert James, Witmer Dan",Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.

40343551,Survival of primary total knee arthroplasty in a modern anatomic implant with and without a short stem extension.,"In primary conventional TKA, the tibial fixation is achieved by the epiphyseal and metaphyseal zone. One of those two zones of fixation, can be compromised by the local bone quality (bone micro-architecture and resistance), previous surgery or decreased surface of contact, leading to micro-mobility of the implant and potentially leading to aseptic loosening (AL). It was our hypothesis that the addition of a short fully cemented stem would improve the metaphyseal and epiphyseal fixation of the implant. To verify this hypothesis, the goals of this retrospective study were therefore to compare if (1) The presence of a short, stubby stem will dissipate stress and decrease micro-mobility at the epiphyseal level resulting in less radiolucent lines around the tibial component. (2) Short stem primary TKA may improve survivorship of the implant in patients potentially at risk for aseptic loosening. Retrospective cohort study of 326 patients operated with a morphometric implant between 2013 and 2018. A short stubby stem was added to the tibial implant, if at the time of the tibial cut, the surgeon judged the epiphyseal bone quality to be poor or a smaller tibial size was necessary. All primary TKA were radiographically evaluated. RLLs were recorded and described according to their radiological aspect, localization, time of appearance and their progression over time. Survivorship was compared in the 2 groups using the national joint registry. 71 TKAs out of 326 (22%) were stemmed. Of the 255 TKAs without stem, 53 (21%) showed RLLs under the tibial base plate and 1 case (0.4%) was revised for potential AL of the tibial implant. No RLLs were observed in the group of stemmed implants and no revisions for aseptic loosening were needed. Patients with stubby stems were elderly women with risk factors for osteoporosis or young men in need for correction of big coronal deformities. A short stubby stem extension can reduce the rate of RLLs and AL in primary TKA, probably by adding metaphyseal fixation to the classic epiphyseal fixation of the tibia and by a reduction in micro- and macro-motion of the tibial component. Based on the results of our study, the addition of a short cemented stubby stem decreased the rate of RLL with no revision observed in the stemmed group during the study period. The used knee system allows this option. Intra-operative decision can be made easily when risk factors such as osteoporosis, female gender, big deformities, obesity can be identified.

40339944,"To Cement or Not? Ten-Year Results of a Prospective, Randomized Study Comparing Cemented versus Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty.","The optimal mode of fixation for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) continues to be a subject of debate. There were 100 cases enrolled to compare cemented and cementless TKA using a modular trabecular metal tibia. This is a report on the 91 cases with follow-up information, including 67 cases with a minimum 10-year follow-up: 36 cases in the cemented cohort (A) and 31 cases in the cementless cohort (B). We previously reported the 2- and 5-year results for this prospective, randomized trial. Knee Society Scores and Oxford scores were collected preoperatively and postoperatively. The mean Knee Society Scores (94.4, 89.1, P = 0.21) and Oxford scores (44.1, 43.9, P = 0.80) were similar in both groups. Group A had two revisions at 5-year follow-up, with three additional revisions for polyethylene wear, osteolysis, and loosening at 10-year follow-up. Group B had two revisions at 5-year follow-up, with two additional revisions for polyethylene wear and instability and instability due to laxity at 10-year follow-up. In total, two group A cases and one group B case were revised for implant fixation complications. Survivorship with any revision as an end point was equivalent between the two cohorts (91.5%, 95.9%, P = 0.60), as was survivorship using tibial tray revision as an end point (93.7%, 95.9%, P = 0.55). No cases demonstrated any progressive radiolucencies. Group A had 5 cases with osteolysis (80% tibial), and Group B had two cases of osteolysis (0% tibial). Cementless and cemented TKA had equivalent patient-reported outcomes and survivorship at 10-year follow-up. Cemented fixation had a higher rate of osteolysis and loosening, which may be related to increased third-body wear. Cementless fixation shows immense potential as a successful option for many patients. Updates to this study cohort are planned at 15- and 20-year intervals to obtain longer-term outcomes.","Olson Nicholas R, Parks Nancy L, Nagda Shaan S, McAsey Craig J, Fricka Kevin B",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Female, Male, Aged, Bone Cements, Prospective Studies, Middle Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Reoperation, Follow-Up Studies, Prosthesis Failure, Treatment Outcome, Aged, 80 and over, Cementation, Prosthesis Design, Knee Joint, Osteoarthritis, Knee",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40339944/,"Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute, Alexandria, Virginia.; Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute, Alexandria, Virginia; Inova Mount Vernon Hospital Joint Replacement Center, Alexandria, Virginia."
40339930,The AAHKS Surgical Techniques and Technologies Award: Synovial Fluid Metal Ion Levels as a Biomarker for Aseptic Loosening Following Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Prospective Study.,"Implant loosening following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains the most common aseptic indication for revision. Aseptic loosening can be difficult to diagnose, as radiographic findings may be absent or difficult to detect or interpret. Commercially available bone cement contains either barium or zirconium to allow for radiographic detection. We hypothesized that implant loosening leads to abrasion-related release of detectable amounts of metal ions from the implant or bone cement, which may serve as biomarkers of aseptic loosening. We prospectively enrolled 50 patients (mean age: 65 years, 52% were women) undergoing revision of a cemented TKA requiring component explantation. Synovial fluid was obtained prior to arthrotomy during revision surgery and analyzed for concentrations of barium, zirconium, titanium, cobalt, and chromium in parts per billion (ppb). The diagnostic utility of each ion for detecting loosening was assessed. The operative surgeon determined whether the femoral and tibial components were well-fixed or loose at the time of removal. There were 25 (50%) patients who had intraoperatively confirmed component loosening. Patients who had confirmed component loosening had elevated levels of zirconium (median levels: 27 versus 6 ppb, P = 0.016) and cobalt (median levels: 16 versus 1.5 ppb, P = 0.002) compared to patients who did not have loosening. The most accurate synovial metal ion levels for diagnosing aseptic loosening were cobalt (area under the curve: 0.76 (95% confidence interval = 0.611 to 0.92); P = 0.001) and zirconium (area under the curve: 0.79 (95% confidence interval = 0.6 to 0.99); P = 0.003). In this series, barium, titanium, and chromium levels were not predictive of component loosening. Aseptic loosening remains a challenging diagnosis without an available confirmatory test. Although the current sample size is limited, our results indicate that synovial fluid cobalt and zirconium levels are valuable indicators of component loosening. In the absence of definitive X-ray findings, synovial fluid analysis offers a promising diagnostic modality. This test can potentially improve patient outcomes by enabling earlier and more accurate detection of aseptic loosening following primary cemented TKA.","Mika Aleksander P, Baker Courtney E, Wilson Jacob M, Pennings Jaquelyn S, Engstrom Stephen M, Polkowski Gregory G, Martin J Ryan",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Female, Aged, Male, Synovial Fluid, Prospective Studies, Prosthesis Failure, Biomarkers, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Reoperation, Cobalt, Bone Cements, Zirconium, Titanium, Chromium, Awards and Prizes, Aged, 80 and over",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40339930/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."
40337672,Cementless unicompartmental knee arthroplasty is safe and effective at a minimum follow-up of 4.2 years: A systematic review.,"Cemented unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a widely used procedure in the treatment of anteromedial and lateral knee osteoarthritis. However, several advantages are reported for cementless UKA, such as improved osseointegration, reduced cement-related costs and complications. The aim of this study was to analyse clinical outcomes, survival, complications, failures and revision rate of cementless UKA. A systematic review was performed on 31 May 2024, on PubMed, Cochrane Library and Scopus. We included randomised clinical trials and prospective and retrospective studies reporting clinical outcomes, implant survival, complications, failures and revision rates of cementless UKA. The following data were extracted: study design, type of implant, number of patients and knees, follow-up, age, sex, pre-operative and post-operative clinical outcomes, reoperations and revisions with causes of failure and overall survival. Fifteen studies were included, involving 3475 patients and 3641 UKA (2568 cementless UKA and 854 cemented UKA). The mean patients' age was 66 years. The mean follow-up was 6.5 years. The Oxford Knee Score improved from 17.8 preoperatively to 40.3 post-operatively in cementless UKA. Knee Society Score improved from 118.2 preoperatively to 168.6 post-operatively in cementless UKA. The reoperation rate was 3.85% for cementless UKA and 9% for cemented UKA. The most common causes of revision were osteoarthritis progression (1.4%), aseptic loosening (0.8%), bearing dislocation and unexplained pain (0.7%). The overall survival of cementless UKA was 96.2% and 93.6% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Cementless UKA is a viable alternative to cemented UKAs with a low failure rate, without a lower clinical benefit at a minimum follow-up of 4.2 years.

40321476,Isolated Zone 2 and Zone 3 Cementless Tibial Fixation Shows Early Promise in Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Fixation in revision total knee arthroplasty(rTKA) should occur in at least 2 zones(epiphysis, metaphysis, or diaphysis) to maximize fixation strength. We report here the short-term survivorship of unsupported tibial base plates in rTKA when used with a cementless metaphyseal sleeve and non-cemented stem. We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing rTKA between 2014 and 2021 by a single surgeon at a single institute. We identified 17 patients with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. The average age at surgery was 66.4 years (range 50-80) and the average BMI was 34.6 (range 22.4-43.3). One patient had Type 1 and 16 patients had Type 2 bone loss preoperatively (Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute classification). Two patients (11.8%) received a standard posterior stabilized insert, nine patients (52.9%) received a varus valgus constrained insert and the remaining 6 (35.3%) patients received a hinged implant. There were no cases of revision for loosening, fracture or mechanical failure of the tibial component construct at an average follow up of 2.9 years (maximum 7.9 years). One patient required revision for end of stem pain. Only 1 patient developed subsidence (≤ 3 mm) but did not have any clinical mechanical symptoms suggestive of loosening. We report a 100% survivorship free of revision for loosening or mechanical failure of the tibial construct at short term follow up when using an unsupported tibial base plate with a metaphyseal sleeve and non-cemented stem. Based on early data, metaphyseal sleeves with a stable stem fixation in the tibia can be used without additional tibial tray fixation with cement.","Maniar Adit R, Kazarian Gregory S, Torres-Ramirez Ricardo J, Ranawat Amar S",Indian journal of orthopaedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40321476/,"Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai, India.; Breach Candy Hospital Trust, Mumbai, India.; Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, USA."
40314040,Hybrid Fixation Achieves Similar or Slightly Better Results Compared With All Cemented Fixation in Oxford Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty at the Short-Term Follow-Up.,"Introduction Cementless Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (OUKA) has been shown to have less frequent radiolucent lines and equivalent or even better results than those of cemented OUKA. However, tibial fractures are more frequent in cementless OUKA than in cemented OUKA, especially in Asian countries. A hybrid option, with a cementless femur and cemented tibia, may, therefore, be a good compromise. This study compares the clinical results of hybrid OUKA with those of fully cemented OUKA. Materials and methods This retrospective study included 108 consecutive unicompartmental knee arthroplasties implanted between September 2016 and September 2018 in our hospital. Cases were divided into two groups: those using cemented fixation and those using hybrid fixation OUKAs. Pre- and postoperative knee range of motion (ROM), operation time, pre-and postoperative Oxford knee score (OKS), and complications were compared between the groups two years after OUKA was performed. Results There was no significant difference in pre- and postoperative ROM, operation time, and OKS performed unilateral OUKA, but mean OKS was higher in the hybrid group than in the cemented group performed bilateral OUKA (p<0.01). Both groups included one revision to total knee arthroplasty each. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of revision (p=0.723). Conclusions Better clinical outcomes were achieved in the hybrid fixation group than in the cemented fixation group, with an equivalent rate of complication. Longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm the benefits of hybrid fixation in OUKA over time.","Saitoh Akira, Hiranaka Takafumi, Okamoto Koji, Fujishiro Takaaki, Koide Motoki, Suda Yoshihito, Tanaka Atsuki, Arimoto Akihiko",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40314040/,"Orthopaedic Surgery and Joint Surgery Centre, Takatsuki General Hospital, Takatsuki, JPN.; Orthopaedic Surgery and Joint Surgery Centre, Takatsuki General Hospital, takatsuki, JPN."
40306670,"A collar is a protective factor against early periprosthetic fracture for cementless stems in total hip arthroplasty : a multivariate analysis in a single-centre cohort of 1,623 total hip arthroplasties.","Periprosthetic fractures (PPFs) are a significant complication in total hip arthroplasty (THA), with their incidence varying from 0.1% to 5.2% in registries. The use of a collared femoral stem may reduce the risk of PPF by enhancing the distribution of load and the stability of the implant. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of collared versus collarless stems on the incidence of PPFs in a large cohort of patients. This retrospective study involved all primary THAs performed in a single centre between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2020. Of the 2,182 THAs performed in 1,767 patients, 559 in 447 patients were excluded for the following reasons: having cemented stems, patients with a femoral neck fracture, dysplasia of the hip, or an oncological indication for surgery. A total of 1,623 THAs in 1,320 patients were included. The data which were collected included the patients' demographics, the surgical approach, the implant characteristics, and the incidence of PPF. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using the Bursac's logistic regression model considering factors such as sex, age, BMI, surgical approach, and the presence of a collar. There were nine PPFs within 90 days of surgery: five in the collared stem group (0.4%) and four in the collarless stem group (1.6%). Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of a collar was the only significant independent predictive factor of a reduced rate of PPFs (p = 0.048). Other factors such as sex, age, BMI, and surgical approach did not show significant correlations. The collared stem was a protective factor against early femoral PPF when cementless stems were used in primary THA. These results support the preference for collared versus collarless cementless stems, particularly in patients who are at a high risk of PPF, to enhance the initial stabilty of the stem and reduce complications.","Favroul Clement, Voirin Florian, Foissey Constant, Batailler Cecile, Lustig Sébastien",The bone & joint journal,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip, Female, Male, Retrospective Studies, Periprosthetic Fractures, Hip Prosthesis, Aged, Middle Aged, Prosthesis Design, Incidence, Multivariate Analysis, Aged, 80 and over, Postoperative Complications, Risk Factors, Protective Factors, Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40306670/,"Orthopaedics Surgery and Sports Medicine Department, FIFA Medical Center of Excellence, Croix-Rousse Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon North University Hospital, Lyon, France.; Univ Lyon, Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, IFSTTAR, Lyon, France."
40280210,New and Improved? Analysis of Generational Implant-Related Failures and All-Cause Revision Indications for Total Knee Arthroplasty Over a 30-Year Period.,"Modern total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implants are designed with the goal of improving patient outcomes and reducing revisions. The purpose of this study was to determine if material and technical advancements in TKA design over three decades have translated to improvements in implant-related revisions, survivorship, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at a high-volume institution. Prospectively collected data were queried for all primary, cemented TKAs performed by eight surgeons from February 1995 to February 2024. A total of 11,767 TKAs were included from three different manufacturers. The primary outcome was the implant-related mechanism of failure. Secondary outcomes included revision indications, survivorship using any revision as an endpoint, survivorship using aseptic revision as an endpoint, and PROMs. Patients who received older-generation implants had significantly longer mean follow-up (mean 6.6, 0 to 25.3, versus mean 2.9, 0 to 11.2 years; P < 0.01). Among the 312 revisions, earlier-generation implant-related failures were most commonly due to implant loosening (1.0%), polyethylene wear (0.3%), and instability (0.3%). The most common causes for revision extrinsically were infection (1.2%), loosening (1.0%), and polyethylene wear (0.3%). The current-generation implant-related failures were most commonly due to implant loosening (0.3%), instability (0.2%), and fracture (0.1%). Reasons for all-cause revision due to extrinsic causes were most commonly due to infection (0.7%) and loosening (0.3%). Survivorship using all-cause revisions as an endpoint (P > 0.05) and using aseptic revisions as an endpoint (P > 0.05) were similar between the two generations. No clinically important differences in postoperative Oxford, Knee Society, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement scores were identified between generational TKA designs. At our institution, the adoption of newer TKA designs has not led to clinically important changes in the 10-year survivorship or PROMs over older generations of high-performing implants from the same manufacturers. The focus should continue to remain on improving implant design and surgical technique.","Olson Nicholas R, Strait Alexander V, Ho P Henry, Fricka Kevin B, Hamilton William G, Sershon Robert A",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Reoperation, Prosthesis Failure, Knee Prosthesis, Male, Female, Aged, Middle Aged, Prosthesis Design, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Aged, 80 and over, Prospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40280210/,"Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute, Alexandria, Virginia.; Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute, Alexandria, Virginia; Inova Mount Vernon Hospital Joint Replacement Center, Alexandria, Virginia."
40279743,Adhesion of bone cement to porous and nonporous 3D printed surfaces.,"Bone cement is an adhesive commonly used to bond orthopedic implants to bone during a surgical procedure. Total joint replacements such as total knee, hip, shoulder, or ankle arthroplasties have metal or polymer components that are commonly cemented. However, implant failures can occur via debonding at the implant-cement interface, suggesting sub-optimal adhesion of the cement to the implant. In parallel, the orthopedic implant industry is seeing a significant rise in additive manufacturing (AM), which enables the seamless integration of surface porosity enhanced osseointegration in cementless procedures. However, there is a lack of foundational data or understanding of how bone cement adheres to 3D printed surfaces as a function of varying topography. This study evaluates adhesion of cement to clinically relevant printed implant surfaces, porous topographies, and materials. Adhesion strength of cemented samples was tested in shear. Surface porous layers were compared to traditional implant surface finishes (blasted, machined, polished). The impact of 3D printed surface porosity size and depth was also investigated. Testing revealed that the adhesive strength of porous surfaces (26.3 ± 3.1 MPa) was more than double the adhesive strength of all non-porous surfaces (the highest being the as-printed surface with a strength of 11.3 ± 2.5 MPa). The study also demonstrated porosity and layer-depth dependent performance trade-offs, with the best performing group having a 2x2x2 mm<sup>3</sup> unit cell size and 0.50 mm layer depth and a shear strength of 26.31 ± 3.10 MPa. These results provide a foundation for improving designs of emerging 3D printed orthopedic implants that can be both cemented and cementless.","Alting Caroline, Walsh William R, Tait Robert, Gall Ken",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,"Printing, Three-Dimensional, Porosity, Surface Properties, Bone Cements, Materials Testing, Adhesiveness, Mechanical Phenomena",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40279743/,"Duke University, USA.

40274614,The vast majority of radiolucent lines disappeared at 3 years follow-up in modern cementless posterior stabilized mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the natural history of radiolucent lines (RLLs) in modern cementless posterior-stabilized (PS) mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at 3-year follow-up. Our cohort was composed of 45 cementless and 45 cemented TKAs. Patients were retrospectively reviewed after 1:1 matching for age, gender, body mass index, and preoperative UCLA score. All operative procedures were performed by a single surgeon using a cementless or cemented TKA of the same design between 2019 and 2021. The incidence of RLLs was reviewed at 1 week, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postoperatively. Bone on-growth over the surface of the implants were also reviewed at 3 years postoperatively. Fisher's exact test, independent Student's t-test, or Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analyses. Although the incidence of RLLs was significantly higher in cementless TKAs (33/45 knees; 73%) than that in cemented TKAs (10/45 knees; 22%, P <.01) at 6 months postoperatively, RLLs in cementless TKAs disappeared in 29 of 33 knees (88%) at 3-year postoperatively and those of cemented TKAs had increased up to 17 of 45 knees (38%). Bone on-growth over the surface of the implants was observed in 43 of 45 knees (93%) in the cementless TKAs at 3 years postoperatively.

40273225,Delamination and Oxidation in Compression-Molded Polyethylene.,"At our institution, surgeons were observing cases of failed total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) with surface delamination of the tibial insert fabricated by direct compression molding. The increase in unexpected failure led us to investigate the prevalence of delamination and its causes through the use of retrieval analysis and reviews of clinical, demographic, and radiographic data. Between 2000 and 2019, a total of 519 Exactech Optetrak posterior-stabilized direct-compression-molded polyethylene inserts had been retrieved. To determine prevalence, we utilized institutional usage data, manufacturer sales to our institution, and hospital records to determine the delamination rate. Eighty-six retrieved specimens (16 with delamination) were assessed for oxidation with use of infrared spectroscopy. Sixty-four (12%) of the 519 inserts had delamination. The delamination rate was 0.36% across the 20-year period. Osteolysis was the reason for revision in 25% of delaminated cases, compared with 4% of non-delaminated cases. The mean oxidation index of the delaminated inserts was 2.67 ± 1.4 (range, 1.2 to 6.6). Delamination was not associated with surgical factors (cement viscosity and tibial insert thickness) or processes associated with manufacturing and implantation of the inserts into the patients (implantation year, shelf life, and packaging and sterilization dates). The lack of causative factors for the increase in delamination was perplexing. In 2021, following the completion of our study, the manufacturer determined that since 2004, polyethylene inserts were packaged in ""non-conforming"" vacuum bags that were missing a secondary barrier layer intended to markedly lessen oxygen permeation. The use of non-conforming bags apparently increased the risk of premature oxidation, delamination, and associated osteolysis. Prognostic Level IV .

40267757,Fractures in Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasty are associated with medial positioning of the femoral component - A retrospective cohort study.,"A. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between femoral component positioning and the incidence of periprosthetic fractures in Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), as well as the effects of component size and preoperative coronal lower limb alignment on fracture risk. B. A retrospective single-center study was conducted, including 1,642 cases of medial UKA performed between July 2015 and December 2022. Patients with symptomatic isolated medial knee osteoarthritis meeting specific selection criteria underwent surgery using either press-fit or cemented fixation based on individual bone quality. Radiographic evaluations were performed preoperatively and postoperatively to assess component positioning and alignment. Statistical analyses included the Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon test, and Pearson's chi-squared test to compare fracture and non-fracture groups. C. Out of 1,642 cases, 15 (0.9%) experienced a tibial periprosthetic fracture. These fractures were significantly associated with medial positioning of the femoral component and smaller component sizes. The fracture group had a higher mean age (74.3 ± 6.2 years) and a higher percentage of females (80%) compared to the non-fracture group. No significant differences were observed in Body Mass Index (BMI) or preoperative coronal alignment between the groups. D. Medial positioning of the femoral component and smaller component sizes in Oxford UKA are associated with an increased risk of tibial periprosthetic fractures. Accurate implant positioning is crucial to minimize fracture risk and improve clinical outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of precise surgical techniques and may inform future guidelines for UKA procedures.

40242187,The use of an ultrasonic cement removal device in revision hip and knee arthroplasty-A matched case-control study.,"The objective of this case series was to investigate the effect of ultrasound-guided cement removal devices on operating time and patient safety in the revision of cemented knee and hip arthroplasties. A total of 11 cases were examined in which ultrasound-guided cement extraction was utilised for implant removal. The primary endpoint of the study was the duration of the surgery. Additionally, the cohort was analysed for the occurrence of intraoperative fractures or postoperative ossification. Postoperative laboratory dynamics of haemoglobin and C-reactive protein levels were also investigated. A matched group of 11 patients who underwent revision arthroplasty using conventional techniques to remove bone cement served as the reference group. Ultrasound-guided removal of cement from the medullary canal was associated with a significantly longer operation time (187.19 min ± 54.4 vs. 121.91 min ± 43.5, (<i>p</i> = 0.0026). Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in haemoglobin drop relative to baseline haemoglobin levels when ultrasound-guided tools were employed for cement removal (2.36 g/dL ± 1.9 vs. 4.54 g/dL ± 1.9, <i>p</i> = 0.0015). Moreover, an intraoperative fracture complication of the femoral shaft was observed when the cement was removed using an ultrasonic cement stripper. A comparison between the two groups reveals a significant increase in surgical duration when cement removal was performed using ultrasound-guided technique. Simultaneously, the use of an ultrasound-assisted system for cement removal did not mitigate the risk of intraoperative bone perforation. Based on the data presented in this study, the authors cannot conclude that the use of ultrasound-guided devices for the removal of cement residues from the medullary canal during revision surgery is superior to conventional techniques.

40236279,"Cemented vs. uncemented total knee arthroplasty in obese patients: A systematic review of implant survival, complications, and clinical outcomes.","Obesity is a primary global health concern that negatively affects the outcomes of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). To mitigate complications, both cemented and uncemented fixation techniques have been considered. However, there remains no consensus in the literature regarding the optimal fixation method for obese patients despite the renewed interest in uncemented fixation. This systematic review aims to compare the survival rates, causes of failure, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) between cemented TKA (cTKA) and uncemented TKA (uTKA) in the obese population. A comprehensive literature search was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines across five databases-PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane-focusing on studies directly comparing cTKA and uTKA in obese patients. The ROBINS-I tool was used to assess the risk of bias, while the PRISMA flow diagram guided the study selection process based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO. Four retrospective studies encompassing 1622 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final qualitative analysis. Among these, 50 % of patients underwent uTKA, with three studies exclusively analyzing individuals with at least class II obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). All four studies reported higher rates of aseptic loosening in the cemented fixation group. However, only two studies demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in implant survival, reduced aseptic loosening, and lower revision rates with cementless fixation in the short-to mid-term follow-up. Regarding clinical outcomes, only one study reported a significant improvement in Knee Society Score (KSS) function, range of motion (ROM), and pain scores in the cementless group compared to the cemented group, particularly in the subgroup analysis of posterior-stabilized constrained TKA. This systematic review suggests that in obese patients, particularly those with BMI ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, cementless fixation offers comparable or superior implant survival rates and lower rates of aseptic loosening compared to cemented fixation in the short-to mid-term follow-up. Furthermore, cementless fixation may provide similar or enhanced clinical outcomes in this high-risk and growing patient population.","Lo Carmine Lorenzo, Onorato Francesco, Burgio Carmelo, Karlos Zepeda, Masoni Virginia, Capella Marcello, Camarda Lawrence, Chirillo Danilo Francesco, Massè Alessandro, Bosco Francesco",Journal of orthopaedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40236279/,"University of Turin, Centro Traumatologico Ortopedico (CTO), Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Turin, Italy.; Adult Reconstruction and Joint Replacement Service, Hospital for Special Surgery, 10021, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Precision Medicine in Medical, Surgical and Critical Care (Me.Pre.C.C.), University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.; Orthopaedics and Traumatology Unit, SS Antonio and Biagio and Cesare Arrigo Hospital, 15121, Alessandria, Italy.; Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, G.F.

40212942,Midterm survival of cementless total knee arthroplasty with a three-dimensional printed metal-backed patellar component from the American Joint Replacement Registry.,"Historically, metal-backed patellar components have shown high early failure rates due to fracture, lack of osseous integration, and polyethylene wear and dissociation. We aimed to describe the survival outcomes of cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) utilizing the first widely used additively manufactured 3-dimensionally printed metal-backed patellar component (AM-MBP) to compare these to other cementless as well as cemented TKA cohorts. There were 35,087 primary cementless TKA procedures in patients ≥65 years of age that utilized the AM-MBP component during the calendar years 2012 to 2020 that were identified from the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR). This AM-MBP cohort was benchmarked against age-similar (≥65 years) cohorts representing all other cementless primary TKA with a patellar component (aggregate cementless, n = 10,755) and all cemented TKA with a patellar component (aggregate cemented, n = 550,908). Cumulative percent revision curves and hazard ratios for all-cause revision were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models that adjusted for age and sex. The cumulative percent all-cause revision (95 % confidence interval (CI)) at 7-year follow-up was 1.9 % (1.7%, 2.1%; 1,051 at risk) for the AM-MBP and 2.5% (2.1%, 2.8%; 1,281 at risk) for other aggregated cementless. and 2.1% (2.1 %, 2.1 %; 105,641 at risk) for the aggregate cemented group. The adjusted hazard ratio for revision comparing AM-MBP with aggregate cementless was 0.77 (0.64, 0.93; <i>P</i> = 0.007), indicating a 23% decreased risk of revision for the AM-MBP group compared with all other cementless TKAs with a patellar component in the AJRR, controlling for age and sex. The improved survivability of primary cementless TKA with AM-MBP versus other cementless TKA suggests that the AM-MBP construct is durable in real-world use in the Medicare-eligible population (age ≥65 years) appears to be comparable to the average durability of other cementless constructs captured by the AJRR.","Mahoney Ormonde, Bhowmik-Stoker Manoshi, Nam Denis, Mont Michael A, Sequeira Sean B, Dunbar Michael",Journal of orthopaedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40212942/,"Athens Orthopedic Clinic, Athens, GA, USA.; Stryker Orthopaedics, Mahwah, NJ, USA.; Rush University, Chicago, IL, USA.; Sinai Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Medstar Union Memorial Hospital, USA.; Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, USA."
40212507,Traumatic Knee Joint Dislocation in a Total Knee Arthroplasty with Rupture of the Popliteal Artery and a Subsequent Prosthesis Change: A Case Report.,"Dislocations of the knee joint due to low-energy trauma following knee arthroplasty are very rare cases. However, when vascular involvement is present, it must be taken very seriously. This study aims to examine the clinical course, diagnostic approach, and surgical management of knee joint dislocation with vascular injury following low-energy trauma in a patient with a pre-existing knee arthroplasty. This case report details the instance of a 67-year-old female patient experiencing an anterior dislocation of the knee joint subsequent to a low-energy fall, occurring years after the surgical implantation of a knee joint prosthesis.Clinically and radiologically, an anterior dislocation of the knee joint accompanied by a rupture of the popliteal artery (PI/III segment) was confirmed. The involvement of the popliteal artery was evident in duplex sonography and computed tomography angiography conducted after closed reduction. The surgical intervention involved performing an end-to-end anastomosis of the popliteal artery, followed by the installation of a cemented rotating hinge knee endoprosthesis. Severe knee joint dislocations often require immediate closed reduction and duplex sonography, potentially leading to emergency surgical intervention. Prioritizing vascular and neurological repair before orthopedic treatment is essential, with follow-up assessments for joint stability recommended.","Tüngler Tim Ludwig, Pawelke Jonas, Khassawna Thaqif El, Heiss Christian, Knapp Gero",Journal of orthopaedic case reports,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40212507/,"Department of Experimental Trauma Surgery, Justus-Liebig-Universität, Giessen, Germany.; Department of Trauma, Hand, and Reconstructive Surgery, University Hospital Giessen GmbH, Giessen, Germany."
40209822,Risk of Early Manipulation in Cemented Versus Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty: An Analysis of the American Joint Replacement Registry.,"Cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has recently regained popularity, yet data has raised concerns about rates of arthrofibrosis following these procedures. The purpose of this study was to utilize the American Joint Replacement Registry to compare rates of early manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) in cementless and cemented primary TKAs that use technology or manual instrumentation. We queried the American Joint Replacement Registry for all patients ages 18 to 95 years who underwent cemented or cementless primary TKA over a 7-year period. Patients were stratified based on whether technology (robotics or computer-assisted navigation) was used during the primary surgery. Groups were then compared for rates of MUA within 90-day of the index surgery using multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 340,841 cases were included in the study, 78,397 (23%) of which used technology and 262,444 (77%) which did not. Within the technology cohort, there were 51,500 (65%) robotic and 26,897 (35%) navigated cases. There were 65% of technology-assisted TKAs and 92% of manual TKAs cemented. In the technology group, multivariable analysis demonstrated significantly higher odds of MUA in cemented TKAs compared to cementless (odds ratio [OR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.06 to 3.59]; P = 0.031). Robotic cases had significantly higher odds of MUA with cemented compared to cementless implants (OR 2.38, 95% CI [1.27 to 4.46]; P = 0.007), while there was no difference in MUA related to cementation in the navigated cases (OR 3.53, 95% CI [0.48 to 25.95]; P = 0.22). In the manual group, there were no significant differences in MUA rates related to cementation use (OR 1.14, 95% CI [0.8 to 1.64]; P = 0.46). Cementless TKA did not increase odds of MUA. In further analyzing cement use into technology and manual cohorts, robotic-assisted cemented TKAs had higher rates of early MUA than cementless. Identification of risk factors leading to early arthrofibrosis may be patient dependent and further study is required to elucidate any surgical considerations.","Schaffler Benjamin C, Zaniletti Isabella, Arshi Armin, De Mita, Schwarzkopf Ran, Rozell Joshua C",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Middle Aged, Aged, Registries, Male, Female, Adult, Aged, 80 and over, Bone Cements, Young Adult, Adolescent, United States, Knee Prosthesis, Cementation, Retrospective Studies, Robotic Surgical Procedures",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40209822/,"NYU Langone Health Department of Orthopedic Surgery, New York, New York.; American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, Rosemont, Illinois."
40202590,Is surgeon assessed bone quality during total knee arthroplasty a valid tool to diagnose osteoporosis?,"Osteoporosis continues to have a high prevalence amongst people undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The surgeon assessed intraoperative bone quality using a visual analogue scale has a strong correlation with bone mineral density. Surgeon assessment of bone quality has a high specificity(100%) and positive predictive value(100%) in diagnosing osteoporosis and osteopenia. Patients undergoing TKA have a high prevalence of osteoporosis. Our aim is to study (a) the correlation of intraoperative surgeon assessed bone quality with bone mineral density(BMD) as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry(DEXA) and (b) the diagnostic strength of intraoperative surgeon assessment of bone quality in diagnosing osteoporosis and osteopenia, in patients undergoing TKA. We prospectively recruited 31 patients undergoing TKA. Patients were classified into normal, osteopenia or osteoporosis based on preoperative DEXA. Intraoperatively, the senior surgeon by visual and tactile assessment, graded the bone quality(BQ) using a visual analogue scale(VAS) from 0 to 10, with 10 being the strongest bone. Using the VAS score, we classified patients as normal(≥ 8), osteopenia(5-7) and osteoporosis(≤ 4). The Spearman's rho correlation between BMD and VAS was 0.954.(p < 0.001). VAS < 8 to diagnose osteopenia and osteoporosis had a sensitivity of 70.83%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100% and diagnostic accuracy of 77.42%(p = 0.001). VAS ≤ 4 to diagnose osteoporosis had a sensitivity of 71.43%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100% and diagnostic accuracy of 93.55%(p < 0.001). The surgeon assessed intraoperative bone quality using a VAS during TKA has a strong correlation with the gold standard BMD as measured by DEXA scan. VAS ≤ 4 can help diagnose osteoporosis, allowing surgeons to augment implant fixation with stem and cement as well as guide osteoporosis treatment postoperatively. VAS < 8 can identify osteopenic or osteoporotic bone, thus allowing the surgeon to better identify weaker bone and help titrate implant choice.","Maniar Adit R, Nayak Akshay, Bavaskar Arpit, Raina Vishal, Khokhar Ashwini, Maniar Rajesh N",Archives of osteoporosis,"Humans, Female, Osteoporosis, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Aged, Bone Density, Absorptiometry, Photon, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Bone Diseases, Metabolic, Aged, 80 and over",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40202590/,"Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai, India.; Breach Candy Hospital Trust, Mumbai, India.; Sir H.

40197835,No difference in 5-year survivorship between cemented versus cementless total knee arthroplasty in a cohort of 5266 patients using a deep-dish mobile bearing implant.,"The best fixation method for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains controversial. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of cemented and cementless fixation on prosthesis survivorship. Our primary hypothesis is that there is no difference in survivorship between cemented and cementless TKA. Our secondary hypothesis is that there is no difference in aseptic revisions and functional outcomes between cemented and cementless TKA at mid-term follow-up. A multicentre retrospective study was done using data collected prospectively in a large cohort. The same deep-dish mobile bearing design was used for both cemented and cementless TKA. Patients were divided into two groups according to the fixation method. The survival rate between cemented and cementless TKA was compared. Functional outcomes were collected preoperatively and at the 5-year follow-up. Of the 5266 primary TKA included, 4549 were cementless, and 717 were cemented. At 5 years, there was no significant difference between the survivorship of the cementless (98.7% [95% confidence interval, CI: 98.2-99.1]) and cemented TKA (97.6%, [95% CI: 94.1-99.1]) (p = 0.468). There was no significant difference in the surgery-free survival at 5 years between cementless (95.8% [95% CI: 94.9-96.5]) and cemented TKA (95.5% [95% CI: 92.1-97.5]) (p = 0.508) as well as in aseptic revision: cementless (96.9% [95% CI: 96.2-97.5]) and cemented TKA (97.5 [95% CI: 95.5-98.6]) (p = 0.355). There was no significant difference in the functional outcomes at 5 years. There was no observed difference in survivorship between cemented and cementless TKA at 5 years in this cohort of 5266 patients. Additionally, rates of reoperation and aseptic revision were similar across both fixation methods, and clinical outcomes did not differ significantly. Therefore, it may be suggested that cementless fixation is a safe option for primary TKA.

40134288,Radiostereometric measurement of implant migration in robotically assisted vs conventional bi-cruciate stabilized cemented total knee arthroplasty: secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.,"Robotically assisted computer navigation (robotic) has been developed to improve the positioning in total knee arthroplasties (TKAs), attempting to achieve better functional results and longevity of the prostheses. However, the benefit of robotics is still controversial. The aim of our study was to compare migration between robotic and conventional techniques in cemented bi-cruciate stabilized TKAs, using radiostereometric analysis (RSA) based on a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We enrolled 60 TKA patients from one hospital (2020-2021), with osteoarthritis or arthritic disease. The patients were examined up to 24 months after the surgery, to estimate the mechanical stability of the tibial component. The maximum total point motion (MTPM) representing the magnitude of migration, the largest negative (subsidence) and positive (lift-off) value for y-translation, and prosthetic rotations were measured. The migration in the 2 groups was compared and the precision evaluated. 51 RSA marked TKAs were available for a comparison of tibial migration between robotically assisted (n = 26) and conventional operations (n = 25). The MTPM in the first year was 0.44 mm and 0.64 mm, and at 24 months 0.46 mm and 0.75 mm, for the conventional and the robotic groups, respectively. The robotic group migrated more than the conventional group at 2 years, 0.21 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05-0.44; P = 0.01). The overall median MTPM for the investigated implants (both groups) up to 12 months was 0.54 mm (CI 0.44-0.63), and 0.19 mm between 12 and 24 months (CI 0.16-0.22). The magnitude of migration and rotation around the 3 axes was small for both groups, but flexion/extension migration of the tibial component was slightly higher in the robotic group 0.14° (CI 0.00-0.33; P = 0.049). MTPM and flexion/extension migrations of the tibial component were higher for the robotic group, up to 24 months. The overall migration pattern for the bi-cruciate stabilized implant was acceptable.","Skåden Øystein, Furnes Ove Nord, Lygre Stein Håkon Låstad, Moldestad Irene Ohlen, Hallan Geir, Fenstad Anne Marie, Høl Paul Johan, Gøthesen Øystein Johannes",Acta orthopaedica,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Radiostereometric Analysis, Male, Female, Aged, Robotic Surgical Procedures, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Prosthesis Failure, Foreign-Body Migration, Aged, 80 and over",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40134288/,"Haugesund Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, Haugesund; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. oystein.skaden@hsr.as.; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen; Norwegian Arthroplasty Register, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital, Helse Bergen HF, Bergen, Norway.; Norwegian Arthroplasty Register, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital, Helse Bergen HF, Bergen; Department of Occupational Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Helse Bergen, Bergen, Norway.; Biomatlab, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital, Helse Bergen HF, Bergen, Norway.; Norwegian Arthroplasty Register, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital, Helse Bergen HF, Bergen; oastal Hospital in Hagevik, Helse Bergen, Bergen, Norway.; Norwegian Arthroplasty Register, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital, Helse Bergen HF, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen; Biomatlab, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Haukeland University Hospital, Helse Bergen HF, Bergen, Norway.; Haugesund Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, Haugesund; Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway."
40126872,Equivalent Six-Week Knee Motion and Patient-Reported Outcome Scores After Cementless and Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty with a Kinematic Alignment Optimized Implant.,"Cemented kinematic alignment (KA) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is popular due to its superior patient-reported outcome scores (PROs). A new cementless version of a KA-optimized implant is available. The femoral component features a 20° trochlear groove and medial spherical articulation. The tibial insert features a medial socket, creating native anterior-posterior stability and a lateral flat articular surface promoting native medial pivot rotation. The present study aimed to determine whether clinical outcomes for patients receiving the cementless KA-optimized implant are equivalent to those receiving the cemented version after six weeks. This comparison is essential because lower PROs could indicate delayed osteointegration of the components, like dysfunction associated with delayed fracture union. The study included 95 cementless KA TKAs matched 1:1 with 95 cemented KA TKAs based on surgery date, age, preoperative knee deformity, sex, and surgeon. Patients completed the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS JR) both preoperatively and at six weeks, as well as the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) at six weeks. A Wilcoxon two-sided equivalence test was used to test the null hypothesis that results were comparable for the cementless and cemented KA TKAs. The analysis included 114 females and 76 males, with a mean age of 68 years and a body mass index (BMI) of 31kg/m². Preoperatively and at six weeks, the age, sex distribution, BMI, knee extension and flexion, OKS, and KOOS JR scores for cementless and cemented KA TKAs were equivalent. At six weeks, the FJS scores were also equivalent. The KA-optimized implant closely resembling native knee morphology did not show evidence of delayed osteointegration. After six weeks, knee motion and PROs were equivalent to those of the cemented implants. However, longer-term monitoring of this new cementless implant is necessary.","Akhtar Muzammil, Howell Stephen M, Nedopil Alexander J, Hull Maury L",Surgical technology international,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40126872/,"1College of Medicine, California Northstate University, Elk Grove, California.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California Davis, Davis, California.; Orthopädische Klinik König-Ludwig-Haus, Lehrstuhl für Orthopädie der Universität Würzburg Würzburg, Germany."
40124734,Retrieval analysis in total knee arthroplasty.,"Retrieval analysis in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been little studied in the literature. A narrative review of the literature to understand the current importance of retrieval analysis in TKA has been conducted. On August 27, 2024, a literature search was performed in PubMed using ""TKA retrieval analysis"" as keywords. A total of 160 articles were found, of which only 19 were analyzed because they were directly related to the subject of this article. Rotating-platform (mobile-bearing) TKA has no surface damage advantage over fixed-bearing TKA. TKAs with central locking mechanisms are more prone to debond from the cement mantle. No major wear of the polyethylene (PE) component in TKA using oxidized zirconium components occurs. Femoral components of cobalt-chromium roughen more than oxidized zirconium femoral components. The use of a polished tibial tray over an unpolished design is advised. At short-run assessment (15 months on average), antioxidant-stabilized highly crosslinked PE components are not clinically different in surface damage, density of crosslinking, or oxidation compared to standard remelted highly crosslinked PE components. A correlation between implant position and PE component surface damage has been reported. It shows the importance of optimizing component position to reduce PE component damage. Contemporary knee tumor megaendoprostheses show notable volumetric metal wear originated at the rotating hinge. Retrieval analysis in TKA renders relevant data on how different prosthetic designs described in the literature perform. Such information can help to improve future prosthetic designs to increase prosthetic survival.","Rodriguez-Merchan Emerito Carlos, Ribbans William J",World journal of orthopedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40124734/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hospital Universitario La Paz-IdiPaz, Madrid 28046, Spain. ecrmerchan@hotmail.com.; Faculty of Health, Education and Society, University of Northampton, Northampton, United Kingdom and The County Clinic, Northampton NN1 5DB, United Kingdom."
40121147,10-Year Follow-Up for a New Three-Dimensional Printed Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) offers the potential for durable fixation through biological integration compared to cemented TKA, where fixation is achieved through mechanical interdigitation of the cement. To our knowledge, no 10-year results are available for newer cementless TKA designs that have incorporated additive manufacturing (three-dimensional [3D] printing). The purpose of this study was to present 10-year survivorship and clinical/radiographic outcomes of a newer cementless TKA design. This is a single institution registry review of prospectively obtained data from a total of 113 cementless TKAs at a 10-year follow-up. Outcomes were determined by comparing pre-and post-operative Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores for Joint Replacement scores and pre- and post-operative 12-item Veterans RAND/Short Form Health Survey. Aseptic loosening as well as revision for any reason were the end points used to determine survivorship at 10 years. The overall survivorship was 96.5% at 10 years, and survivorship for aseptic loosening as the end point was 98.2%, with a 99.1% survivorship of the 3D printed tibial component. There were four revisions performed (all within 2 years postoperatively) for an overall revision rate of 3.5%: two infections (1.7%) and two loosenings (1.7%). No new loosening was identified after 2 years of follow-up. At long-term 10-year follow-up, the mean Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores for Joint Replacement score improved from 38.2 preoperatively to 72.8 postoperatively (P = 0.0001), the mean 12-item Veterans RAND/Short Form Health Survey scores improved from physical health-29.8 preoperatively to 40.6 postoperatively (P = 0.0001), and the mental health scores improved from 37.02 preoperatively to 54.3 postoperatively (P = 0.0001).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and radiological outcome of the cemented Attune knee and to assess the rate of radiolucent lines (RLL) at a median follow-up of 4 years. In this single-center cohort study, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical and radiological results of 165 consecutive patients following cemented TKA with the original design of the Attune knee at a minimum follow-up of two years. Postoperative radiographs were assessed for RLL and clinical outcome was measured using patient reported outcome scores. A total of 115 patients (127 knees) were available for assessment at a mean follow-up of 47.8 ± 12.9 months. The overall incidence of femoral and tibial RLL was 24% and 26%, respectively. Of the original cohort, two patients had to be revised during the course of the study, resulting in a survival rate of 98.9% at two years with the endpoint ""revision for any reason"". Clinical outcome scores improved significantly up to the latest follow-up. The findings of this study demonstrated good clinical results with significant improvement in pain and knee function and acceptable revision rates at a median follow-up of 4 years. However, a high incidence of periprosthetic RLL was seen in this cohort. No implant showed signs of component loosening, but patients with RLL should be monitored closely and future studies with longer follow-up durations are necessary to investigate the influence of these radiolucencies on the long-term performance of this knee system.","Sorbi Reza, Walker Tilman, Nees Timo A, Renkawitz Tobias, Moradi Babak, Reiner Tobias",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Retrospective Studies, Male, Female, Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Radiography, Aged, 80 and over, Prosthesis Design, Knee Joint, Bone Cements, Prosthesis Failure, Incidence, Follow-Up Studies, Postoperative Complications",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40111513/,"Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Orthopaedics, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Orthopaedics, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. tobias.reiner@med.uni-heidelberg.de."
40085222,Accuracy and clinical outcomes in total knee arthroplasty using an image-free navigation system.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of an image-free navigation system and to investigate the effect of the postoperative coronal lower limb alignment and implant alignment on clinical outcomes following mechanically aligned (MA)-total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In this retrospective study, 180 primary cemented posterior-stabilized TKAs were performed using an image-free navigation system. Patients were divided into groups based on their postoperative hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA; a neutral HKA group [0 ± 3°] and an outlier group [<-3° or > 3°]), lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA; a neutral LDFA group [90 ± 3°] and an outlier group [< 87° or > 93°]), and medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA; a neutral MPTA group [90 ± 3°] and an outlier group [< 87° or > 93°]). The range-of-motion, 2011 Knee Society score (2011 KSS), and Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12) were compared between the neutral and outlier groups at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. The percentage of knees with a neutral HKA was 91.1% and clinical outcomes significantly improved postoperatively. No significant differences were detected between the neutral HKA (n = 164) and outlier groups (n = 16, all varus) for any clinical outcome. Considering LDFA, the outlier group was too small (n = 3, all varus) for statistical analysis. The overall 2011 KSS and symptoms at 2 years postoperatively and FJS-12 at 1 and 2 years postoperatively were significantly higher in the neutral MPTA group (n = 174) than in the outlier group (n = 6, all varus). The accuracy of an image-free navigation system was satisfactory in MA-TKA and led to good clinical outcomes. No significant differences in clinical outcome were detected between postoperative patients with an HKA within 3° of the neutral position and postoperative patients with an HKA <-3°.

40083895,"Revision Rates for Aseptic Loosening in the Obese Patient: A Comparison Between Stemmed, Uncemented, and Unstemmed Tibial Total Knee Arthroplasty Components.","Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective treatment option for high body mass index (BMI) patients achieving similar outcomes to nonobese patients. However, increased rates of aseptic loosening in patients with a high BMI have been reported. Component fixation is a concern when performing TKA in the obese patient. To address this concern in cemented TKA, extended tibial stems have been used. Uncemented implants that take advantage of biologic osseointegration have also been advocated. This retrospective study examined the use of and revision rates of extended cemented tibial stems and uncemented implants compared with conventional cemented implants in our high BMI patient population. We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively maintained database of 3239 primary Attune TKAs (Depuy, Warsaw, Indiana). All obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with > 30 months of follow-up were included in our analysis. Those who underwent cemented TKA using a tibial stem extension (Group 1) (n = 145) and those where cementless implants were used (Group 2) (n = 100) were compared to a control group (n = 1243) using a standard cemented implant. Primary outcome measures were all-cause revision, revision for aseptic loosening, and revision for tibial loosening. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression models were used to compare the primary outcomes between groups. In total, there were 1512 knees that met the inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up was 6.8, 5.1, and 5.3 years for cemented, stemmed, and cementless groups, respectively. There were 37 all-cause revisions identified. Seven were for aseptic loosening (2 tibial, 1 femoral, and 4 involving both components); all of these were in the standard cemented implant group. There were no revisions in the stemmed or cementless implant groups. Survival analysis did not show any significant differences between groups for either all-cause revision or for aseptic loosening. This retrospective analysis showed that there were no revisions required for aseptic loosening when a cemented, stemmed, or uncemented implant was used in obese patients. These findings show that cementless and extended stem implants are a reasonable option in obese patients.

40081605,Uncemented Total Knee Arthroplasty in the State of Michigan has Higher Rates of Revision Through 5-Year Follow-Up.,"While cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is considered the gold standard, uncemented designs are gaining popularity, especially in young men who are at higher risk of cemented failure. Assessing this growth's impact, the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative analyzed adoption rates of uncemented TKA and the effect of fixation technique on revision rates with the goal of assessing the revision rates and survivorship at five years of cemented versus uncemented TKA to further classify which patients may be more ideal candidates for cementless fixation. The Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative data from 2017 to 2022 was analyzed to determine the survivorship of cemented versus uncemented TKAs. Descriptive statistics, demographics, and implant type were collected. Cumulative percent revision (CPR) was calculated based on the fixation method. The primary endpoint was time for the first revision. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared. Subanalyses were performed based on age, sex, body mass index, and implant type. Confidence intervals were set to 95%. The registry query yielded 147,838 TKAs. There were 18,523 (12.5%) uncemented TKAs. Uncemented TKA use increased yearly from 2017 to 2022 in all groups. Uncemented TKA had higher CPR through five years at all time points versus cemented (3.65 versus 3.19%, P < 0.0001). Uncemented TKA performed worse in both men and women (P < 0.01, P < 0.01). Unexpectedly, men < 55 years had higher CPR at all time points for the four most used implants (P < 0.05). The use of uncemented TKA has grown in Michigan across all patient subgroups. Uncemented TKAs had an overall higher risk of revision compared to cemented TKAs. The poorer outcomes appeared consistent across sex, age, and implant type. Younger men who are often preferred for uncemented fixation had higher failure rates. This study suggests that surgeons should be mindful of revision rates and patient selection when moving to uncemented TKA.","Paull Thomas Z, Weaver Martin J, Comer Brendan J, Zheng Huiyong T, Hallstrom Brian R, Hughes Richard E, Markel David C",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Reoperation, Female, Michigan, Middle Aged, Aged, Registries, Follow-Up Studies, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Failure, Prosthesis Design, Adult, Aged, 80 and over",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40081605/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Ascension-Providence Hospital, Southfield, Michigan.; MARCQI Coordinating Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan; MARCQI Coordinating Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Ascension-Providence Hospital, Southfield, Michigan; MARCQI Coordinating Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan; The Core Institute, Novi, Michigan."
40074599,Analysis of Femoral Flexion Angle Distribution and Range of Motion in Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Optimal coronal and rotational alignment in total knee arthroplasty is essential for satisfactory outcomes. There has been limited focus on sagittal alignment in assessing outcomes. This study investigated the impact of femoral implant flexion (FF) angle on knee kinematics and postoperative outcomes. In this multicenter, prospective case series, we analyzed demographics, preoperative and postoperative range of motion (ROM), and implant alignment in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty with a computed tomography-based robotic system. The study included 976 patients (age 66 years [range, 38 to 90]; body mass index 32.6 [range, 14.3 to 50.2]; 56.6% women). The ROM was assessed at four intervals: preoperative, early postoperative, middle postoperative, and late postoperative. Patients were divided into ""high FF"" and ""low FF"" groups based on mean FF. Comparisons were made using t-tests and Pearson's Chi-square tests. The average FF was 4.05° ± 2.10 (range, 0 to 9). The low FF group (n = 528) had a mean FF of 2.45° ± 1.28. The high FF group (n = 448) had a mean of 5.93° ± 1.06. No differences were found in patient height, weight, or body mass index. No differences were noted in preoperative knee alignment or ROM between groups. The high FF patients were more frequently women (62.5 versus 53.0%; P = 0.006), had more cemented implants (20.4 versus 14.4%; P = 0.020), and had smaller implants (P < 0.001). At the latest follow-up, a nonclinically significant difference in extension ROM was noted (low FF 0°, high FF 0.1°; P = 0.050). No differences in flexion ROM were observed at any visit. The FF angles showed a normal distribution, with higher angles associated with cemented implants, smaller implants, and women. No clinically meaningful differences in ROM were found between the high and the low FF groups across all visits.","Haikal Emil R, Katchis Christopher S, Ang Bryan K, Bass Robert D, Reinhardt Keith R, Germano James A, Danoff Jonathan R, Slover James D",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Female, Aged, Range of Motion, Articular, Male, Middle Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Prospective Studies, Knee Joint, Femur, Knee Prosthesis, Adult, Biomechanical Phenomena, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40074599/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Northwell Orthopaedic Institute, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, New York.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, South Shore University Hospital, Northwell Health, Bay Shore, New York.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Long Island Valley Stream Hospital Northwell Health, Valley Stream, New York.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Northwell Health, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, New York."
40054380,Aseptic loosening is associated with medial tilting and anterior translational migration of the tibial implant in mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty.,"Aseptic loosening is a significant cause of implant revision in total knee arthroplasty, and radiostereometric analysis has been used to predict loosening by measuring implant migration over time relative to its position at the time of the index surgery. Studies have suggested that analyzing specific migration patterns may improve prediction of loosening, compared to using measures of the Maximum Total Point Motion alone. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether patients monitored using radiostereometric analysis who experienced either aseptic loosening or revision exhibited distinctive tibial implant migration patterns. Extending a previous study using radiostereometric analysis, we calculated the 6-degree-of-freedom tibial implant migration patterns for seven patients with cemented mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty implants who either developed aseptic loosening or were candidates for revision. We used simple linear regression to identify trends over time. We observed two trends that achieved statistical significance: negative rotation in the coronal plane (medial tilting) of the tibial implant (b = 0.26<sup>0</sup>/month, p < 0.001) and anterior translation (b = 0.67 mm/month, p = 0.005). Our study showed two statistically detectable migration trends associated with tibial component aseptic loosening. Although we were unable to assess in this study whether focusing on migration patterns in these directions provides greater predictive value than using Maximum Total Point Motion, the results suggest that certain migration mechanisms are more prevalent than others, which could motivate further research into the causes of such migration patterns.","Hickey Matthew D, Kaptein Bart L, Anglin Carolyn, Masri Bassam A, Hodgson Antony J","Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)","Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Prosthesis Failure, Male, Aged, Female, Knee Prosthesis, Tibia, Radiostereometric Analysis, Middle Aged, Knee Joint, Aged, 80 and over, Reoperation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40054380/,"School of Biomedical Engineering, the University of British Columbia, 2635 Laurel St, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.

40049562,The Influence of Obesity on Unicondylar Knee Arthroplasty.,"Some prior studies suggest obesity increases unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) failure risk. This study evaluated obesity's impact on UKA outcomes at a single institution. We analyzed 4,973 primary cemented medial UKAs performed by eight surgeons from 2000 to 2022. The primary outcome was implant survivorship. Secondary outcomes included revision rates, reasons for revision, patient-reported outcomes, and clinical metrics. The mean age was 66 years (range, 33 to 96), 54.6% were women, body mass index (BMI) averaged 29.9 (range, 15.6 to 63.4), and follow-up averaged 5.1 years. Outcomes were stratified by BMI cutoffs (BMI: 30; 35; 40), yielding group sizes of ≤ 30 (N = 2,858), > 30 (N = 2,115), ≤ 35 (N = 4,137), > 35 (N = 836), ≤ 40 (N = 4,680), and > 40 (N = 293). At 5 and 10 years, implant survivorship was 95.7 and 92.8%, respectively. At 5 years, survivorship remained high but declined slightly with increased BMI for the 30 and 35 cutoffs (≤ 30: 96.7%, > 30: 94.2%, P < 0.001; ≤ 35: 95.8%, > 35: 94.9%; P = 0.005), while a slight, nonsignificant increase occurred for BMI > 40 (≤ 40: 95.7%, > 40: 96.0%; P = 0.325). Arthritis progression was the most common revision reason, and it increased with BMI. Infection rates remained low across all BMIs. There was no difference in the percentage of patients achieving a minimal clinically important difference using the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Joint Replacement with each BMI cutoff, but Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Joint Replacement score changes were significantly greater in the higher BMI patients using the BMI 30 cutoff (P = 0.034). While higher BMI patients had marginally higher rates of revision, we remain enthusiastic about UKA in these patients due to low infection rates across all BMI cohorts and improvements in patient-reported outcome measures.","Fricka Kevin B, Nwankwo Tobenna N, Sershon Robert A, Parks Nancy L, Strait Alexander V, Hamilton William G",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Female, Aged, Obesity, Male, Middle Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Reoperation, Body Mass Index, Prosthesis Failure, Adult, Knee Prosthesis, Retrospective Studies, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40049562/,"Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute, Alexandria, Virginia; Inova Mount Vernon Hospital Joint Replacement Center, Alexandria, Virginia.; Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute, Alexandria, Virginia."

The purpose of this study was to compare 5-year survivorship of tibial components placed in 3° or greater of varus alignment versus neutral mechanical alignment (nMA). This was a retrospective matched cohort study of 530 patients with 265 patients who underwent primary robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with tibial components intentionally placed in varus matched to a control group of 265 patients who underwent TKA using manual instrumentation with tibial components placed in nMA. Both cementless and cemented implants were used in both groups. There was no difference between groups with respect to patient sex or age. There were 100 and 87.5% of patients who had a minimum 5-year follow-up in the tibial varus and nMA groups, respectively. Outcomes included survivorship, complications, revisions, and patient-reported outcome measures. All-cause survivorship at 5 years postoperatively was 98% in the group with constitutional tibial varus and 96% in the nMA group (P = 0.12). There were no cases of aseptic loosening in the group with tibial component varus. There were five patients who required revision in the varus group versus 14 in the nMA group (P = 0.02). There was a significant difference in nonrevision intervention for stiffness between the two groups in favor of the varus group (three versus 14, P = 0.003). Similar survivorship was demonstrated at a mid-term 5-year follow-up between patients undergoing primary TKA using a functional alternative alignment concept with tibial components intentionally placed in 3° or greater of varus compared to nMA. Tibial components placed in constitutional or anatomic varus, in an attempt to restore the native oblique joint line along with well-balanced gaps, demonstrated 98% survivorship at 5 years.","Bhimani Rohat B, Whitaker John E, Mullick Maunil, Clark Gavin W, Lee Serene, Collopy Dermot M, Smith Langan S, Malkani Arthur L",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Female, Retrospective Studies, Aged, Middle Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Tibia, Aged, 80 and over, Prosthesis Failure, Bone Malalignment, Knee Joint, Follow-Up Studies, Robotic Surgical Procedures, Reoperation, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40049559/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky.; Department of Orthopaedics, St. John of God Subiaco Hospital, Perth, Australia.; Perth Hip and Knee Clinic, Perth, Australia.; UofL Health, Jewish Hospital, Louisville, Kentucky."
40047935,Utilizing 3d-printed patient-specific porous titanium cones in complex primary and revision total knee arthroplasty.,"Effective management of bone defects is crucial in revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) to ensure implant stability in low-density bone environments, especially following prosthesis removal. While various reinforcement techniques exist, such as allografts, augments, metal cones, sleeves, or combinations thereof, metal cones are increasingly favored for their ability to reconstruct significant bone defects. A prominent challenge with off-the-shelf (OTS) cones is their unsuitability for Asian and specifically Iranian anatomies due to mismatched sizes and smaller medullary canals. This study explores the application of customized 3D-printed porous titanium cones, tailored to individual patient anatomy, for bone defect reconstruction in complex primary or revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Utilizing CT scans for 3D preoperative planning, porous cones were individually designed to fit each patient's anatomy. A novel aspect of these cones is their dual functionality: promoting bone ingrowth while preventing cement infiltration. The cones were fabricated using selective laser melting with medical-grade Ti6Al4V alloy. To aid in surgical preparation, single-use polyamide trials were also 3D-printed. A total of nineteen cones/half cones (four diaphyseal, twelve metaphyseal, and three meta-diaphyseal) for femoral and tibial applications were successfully designed and implanted across ten cases. There was a perfect alignment between preoperative planning and intraoperative outcomes, with precise defect reconstruction achieved in all cases. Early follow-ups indicated no loosening or implant migration. Customized patient-specific porous cones offer not only the long-term benefits of OTS options, such as osseointegration and biological fixation but also accurately address a wide range of complex metaphyseal and diaphyseal defects. This approach preserves residual bone stock and streamlines the surgical process, presenting a promising advancement in bone defect management in rTKA.","Vaziri Arash Sharafat, Moradkhani Ghazaleh, Farahmand Farzam, Karimpour Morad, Tahmasebi Mohammad Naghi, Vosoughi Fardis, Salimi Maryam, Shayan-Moghadam Ramin",European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,"Humans, Printing, Three-Dimensional, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Titanium, Knee Prosthesis, Reoperation, Prosthesis Design, Porosity, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Male, Female, Aged, Alloys, Middle Aged, Tibia",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40047935/,"Center for Orthopedic Trans-Disciplinary Applied Research, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; School of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.; Mechanical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.; School of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. m.karimpour@ut.ac.ir.; Department of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."
40042685,Electromagnetic induction disinfection applied to cemented knee arthroplasty implants: safety evaluation of potential changes in the bone cement.,"Electromagnetic induction heating is a newly developed disinfection method aimed at improving periprosthetic infection outcomes after Debridement and Implant Retention (DAIR). One safety concern is its effect over polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The objective of this in-vitro study is to assess such effect on cement adjacent to metallic arthroplasty components. Two different PMMA products, with and without antibiotic, were applied on three total-knee arthroplasty implants. A portable device was used to administer induction-heating protocols: 70 °C, 3.5 min and 100 °C, 3.5 min, while the third prosthesis served as control. The 602 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 558 cm<sup>-1</sup> bands in Raman spectroscopy were used to assess isotactic and syndiotactic components of PMMA, while 1339 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1295 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 882 cm<sup>-1</sup> bands in infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were used to assess crystallinity. Isotactic/syndiotactic ratios were 0.27(±0.02) for antibiotic-free cement, and 0.41(±0.02) for gentamicin-loaded cement. After induction-heating protocols, isotactic fraction increased in antibiotic-free cement, and decreased in gentamicin-loaded cement. No evidence of crystallization was found in ATR-FTIR, except for a small increase in 1340 cm<sup>-1</sup> band after 100 °C protocol. Spectroscopic techniques confirmed that PMMA only experienced minor structural changes after induction heating treatments. From a structural viewpoint, these results suggest that electromagnetic induction heating could be a safe disinfection technique for cemented implants in total knee arthroplasty.","Cordero García-Galán Enrique, Rezusta Francisco Javier Medel, Sarnago Héctor, Burdio José M, Lucía Óscar, Esteban Jaime, Gómez-Barrena Enrique",Journal of materials science.

40020944,Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty Using an Ultraconforming Tibial Bearing: Outcomes at Minimum 5-Year Follow-Up.,"Cementless fixation for primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) continues to increase in the United States. However, compared to cemented TKA, reports on revision rates have been mixed. A confounding variable may include the tibial insert design. This study aimed to assess the minimum 5-year survivorship and outcomes of a cementless TKA using an ultracongruent (UC) articulation. A consecutive series of 242 cementless TKAs were implanted at two institutions between 2017 and 2019 using an UC kinematic tibial insert. Of the patients, 56% were men. The average age was 60 years. Patients were followed using Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS-JR) and Knee Society clinical and radiographic scores. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs were classified according to the Coronal Plane Alignment of the Knee (CPAK) type. The average follow-up was 5.6 years (range, five to 7.5). At the final follow-up, KOOS-JR scores averaged 84.0. Knee Society scores averaged 94. Flexion averaged 116°. There were seven manipulations (2.9%), one patella fracture, and no deep infections. There were seven knees (2.9%) revised (three for flexion instability, one for pain, one for femoral fibrous ingrowth, one for distal femur fracture, and one for arthrofibrosis). At 5 years, survivorship free from aseptic loosening was 99.6%. Change in CPAK type did not correlate with final KOOS-JR, pain, University of California Los Angeles activity score, or satisfaction scores. Cementless TKA using this conforming design has provided excellent clinical results out to 5 years. Once initial component stability is achieved, the UC nature of this articulation does not appear to adversely influence the durability of implant fixation, regardless of whether the CPAK type was changed.","Meding John B, Meneghini R Michael, Meding Lindsey K, Deckard Evan R, Buller Leonard T",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Female, Middle Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Follow-Up Studies, Aged, Prosthesis Design, Treatment Outcome, Tibia, Knee Joint, Retrospective Studies, Range of Motion, Articular, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Reoperation, Aged, 80 and over, Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40020944/,"Indiana Joint Replacement Institute, Noblesville, Indiana.; Indiana Joint Replacement Institute, Noblesville, Indiana; The Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana.; The Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana; The IU Hip and Knee Center, IU Saxony Hospital, Fishers, Indiana."

The 2.5-year implant survival rate of cementless UKA was significantly higher compared to cemented UKA in patients aged younger than 60 years (age < 50 years: 95.9% (95% CI 93.8 to 97.3) vs 90.9% (95% CI 87.0 to 93.7); p = 0.007; and 50 to 59 years: 95.6% (95% CI 94.9 to 96.3) vs 94.0% (95% CI 92.8 to 95.0); p = 0.009). Cemented UKA exhibited significantly higher revision rates for tibial loosening (age < 50 and 60 to 69 years), while cementless UKA was associated with higher revision rates for periprosthetic fractures (age ≥ 60 years). Patient-reported outcomes were similar between both fixation techniques, irrespective of age. Cementless fixation resulted in superior short-term implant survival compared to cemented fixation among younger patients undergoing Oxford mobile-bearing medial UKA. Distinct failure patterns between fixation techniques emerged across various age groups, with revisions for tibial loosening being associated with cemented UKA in younger patients, while revisions for periprosthetic fractures were specifically identified among elderly patients undergoing cementless UKA.","Ten Noever de Brauw Gaby V, Vossen Roderick J M, Bayoumi Tarik, Sierevelt Inger N, Burger Joost A, Pearle Andrew D, Kerkhoffs Gino M M J, Spekenbrink-Spooren Anneke, Zuiderbaan Hendrik A",The bone & joint journal,"Humans, Aged, Middle Aged, Prosthesis Failure, Male, Female, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Registries, Age Factors, Netherlands, Knee Prosthesis, Bone Cements, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Cementation, Prosthesis Design, Reoperation, Aged, 80 and over, Osteoarthritis, Knee",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40020722/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery, Computer Assisted Surgery Center & Sports Medicine, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York City, New York, USA.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Orthopaedic Department, Spaarne Gasthuis Academy, Hoofddorp, Netherlands.; Orthopaedic Department, Xpert Clinics, Leiderdorp, Netherlands.; Charité-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität and Humboldt Universität, Berlin, Germany.; Amsterdam Movement Sciences, Sports, Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Dutch Arthroplasty Register (Landelijke Registratie Orthopedische Implantaten), 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Medical Clinic Velsen, Velsen-Noord, Netherlands."
40015381,Body Mass Index Is Not Associated With Risk for Mechanical Loosening Following Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty: An Analysis From the American Joint Replacement Registry.,"Conflicting evidence leaves surgeons without clarity on the association of elevated body mass index (BMI) with the risk of mechanical loosening after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This investigation examined the associated risk of mechanical loosening following TKA based on BMI. We analyzed American Joint Replacement Registry data in patients aged 65 years or more from January 2012 to March 2022 who had a minimum of 2-year follow-up linked to supplemental Centers for Medicare and Medicaid data. We identified primary TKAs and excluded those with hybrid or reverse hybrid fixation, missing component data, highly constrained implants, and augments. A secondary analysis evaluated supplemental tibial stem fixation. Patients were stratified into two groups: those who had an elevated BMI more than 35 (n = 50,557) and patients who had a BMI less than 35 (n = 148,573). Cumulative Incident Function curves and cause-specific Cox models evaluated the risk of revision for mechanical loosening, adjusting for sex, age, cruciate-retaining versus posterior-stabilized femoral design, cemented versus cementless fixation, patellar resurfacing, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) demonstrated no difference in associated risk for mechanical loosening for elevated BMI patients (HR: 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97 to 1.01; P = 0.32). The Cumulative Incident Function curves showed no difference in the risk of mechanical loosening across all time points. An additional 2,956 cases were identified with supplemental tibial stem fixation; there was no difference in associated risk for mechanical loosening for elevated BMI patients with supplemental fixation (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.07 to 18.21; P = 0.93). Patients who had an elevated BMI had no associated risk for mechanical loosening following TKA with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Additional tibial stem fixation was not associated with the risk of mechanical loosening for elevated BMI patients. Further investigation is essential to discern other potentially modifiable etiologies for the risk of mechanical loosening.

39995591,Utilizing Evolved Extramedullary Techniques for Conventional Knee Arthroplasty in Post-traumatic Knee Arthritis With Retained Hardware: A Retrospective Analysis.,"Introduction For post-traumatic knee arthritis with retained implants, performing conventional primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can be challenging due to altered bony structures or mechanical obstructions. Without current computer-aided navigation, we can still perform conventional TKA by extramedullary means according to the parallelism and the reference to inherent anatomical landmarks. In this study, we aim to present a novel extramedullary method applied during conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and the clinical outcomes observed in our series. Methods Between April 2014 and March 2021, patients with post-traumatic knee arthritis and retained hardware scheduled for TKAs at our institute were included. All the index procedures were performed with primary cemented TKA prostheses by the same surgeon. After the proximal tibial cut perpendicular to the tibial shaft, the following distal femur cut was executed according to the parallelism between these cuts. Certain interfering hardware located on the metaphyseal area, like screws or staples, were removed as needed. In addition, most of the conventional principles and techniques in traditional knee replacement were followed. Clinical outcomes, including perioperative blood loss, transfusion rate, inpatient stay, knee functional score, and radiographic evaluation, were recorded and reviewed. Results Within a period of eight years, there were 12 patients with a mean age of 67.8 years old enrolled. Overall, there was a good restoration of optimal mechanical alignment after surgery, and the mean hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle was 180.2<sup>o</sup> compared to their preoperative deformity (HKA 174.0<sup>o</sup> ± 10.4<sup>o</sup>). Clinical assessments according to the Knee Society score showed good knee scores (87.1), functional scores (87.1), and motion arc (106.7<sup>o</sup>). No patient required allogenic blood transfusion or prolonged stays (range: five to eight days). In the last outpatient visit, no radiographic implant failure was found, and no surgical site-specific complications were reported after clinical follow-ups for at least two years. Conclusions Our results suggest that post-traumatic knee arthritis with remnant hardware can be safely and effectively treated with conversion TKAs according to the suggested extramedullary (EM) techniques in this study. With minimal removal of interfering hardware, reduced surgical trauma as well as operation time, helps to achieve short-term clinical benefits, including reduced blood loss, inpatient stay, faster recovery, and even restoration of optimal limb alignment.","Chang Chih-Wei, Tseng Yu-Kai, Chen Yen-Nien, Yang Chyun-Yu",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39995591/,"Orthopedics, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, TWN.; Joint Reconstruction Center, Orthopedics, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, TWN.; Orthopedic Surgery, Kuo General Hospital, Tainan, TWN.; Orthopedic Surgery, Pingtung Veterans General Hospital, Pingtung, TWN.; Institute of Biomedical Science, National Sun-Yat Sen University, Kaohsiung, TWN.; Physical Therapy, Asia University, Taichung, TWN.; Orthopedics, Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, TWN."
39987394,Returning to running after total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and a novel multimodal protocol.,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the gold standard for advanced knee osteoarthritis and is increasingly performed on younger, active individuals. While low-impact sports are recommended after TKA, running remains controversial due to concerns about implant loosening. Cemented implants have durability issues at the bone-cement interface, while cementless designs seem to promote better osseointegration. Despite limited research, running after TKA is gaining acceptance. The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic review of the literature and present a novel and specific protocol to guide motivated patients in safely resuming running. We conducted a systematic review of PubMed studies regarding running after TKA and the PRISMA flow diagram shows the inclusion and exclusion criteria adopted. In addition, we present a novel protocol (FAST) specifically designed for TKA patients aiming to return to running which combines surgical techniques, perioperative analgesia, and physical therapy. It has been approved by the Ethics Board, the prospective trial is registered (NCT06383936), and we are currently enrolling participants. After screening according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, six studies were included in the analysis. The FAST protocol combines cementless CR-design implants, minimally invasive surgery, and personalized functional alignment. Local infiltration analgesia reduces pain and enables rehabilitation within 24 h. Rehabilitation progresses with range-of-motion exercises, muscle strengthening, and gradual return to running at 6-8 months. Monitoring activity carefully prevents inflammation, optimizing recovery. Running after TKA, once discouraged, now shows low complication rates. Preoperative fitness and patient-specific factors are key predictors of success. The FAST protocol integrates cementless implants, personalized alignment, and structured rehabilitation. Proper patient selection and communication are essential. Further research is required to validate long-term outcomes.","Faldini C, Traina F, Digennaro V, Berti L, Panciera A, Cecchin D, Ferri R, Benvenuti L, Calbucci L",Musculoskeletal surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Running, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Return to Sport, Knee Prosthesis",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39987394/,"1st Orthopeadic and Traumatologic Clinic, IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Via Giulio Cesare Pupilli 1, 40136, Bologna, Italy.; Orthopedics-Traumatology and Prosthetic Surgery and Hip and Knee Revision, IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.; Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Unit, IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, 40136, Bologna, Italy.; 1st Orthopeadic and Traumatologic Clinic, IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Via Giulio Cesare Pupilli 1, 40136, Bologna, Italy. alessandro.panciera@ior.it."
39966916,Metaphyseal sleeve and straight stem fixation with or without screws for bone defect in complex primary total knee arthroplasty in Eastern Asian populations.,"Massive bone defects present significant challenges in complex primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Previous studies with limited sample sizes have demonstrated the potential of metaphyseal sleeves (MS) in addressing such defects. This study mainly aimed to assess the clinical outcomes and survivorship of MS utilized for reconstructing bone defects in complex primary TKA among East Asian patients, with a secondary focus on the use of scews for tibial residual bone defect. A total of 3,672 primary TKAs were performed between January 2016 and December 2020, of which 106 procedures (87 patients) utilized MS in conjunction with straight stems to address bone defects. Among these, 55 (46 patients) incorporated screws for tibial residual bone defect, while 51 (41 patients) were performed without screws. The mean follow-up period was 57.86 months, during which demographic data, operative details, clinical and radiographic outcomes, complications, and implant survivorship were recorded and analyzed. All cases demonstrated successful osteointegration, with both the endpoint reoperation and revision implant survival rates reaching 100%. The mean Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score significantly improved from 56.98 to 82.36 at the final follow-up, resulting in an overall excellent and good outcome rate of 95.40%. Knee conditions were notably worse in the screw group compared to the non-screw group; however, the clinical and radiographic outcomes between the two groups were comparable. Postoperative tibial end-of-stem pain was reported in 9.8% of the non-screw group, while none (0%) in the screw group, reflecting marginal significance (P = 0.0548). The application of metaphyseal sleeves with straight stems represents a promising strategy for addressing massive bone defects in complex primary TKA among East Asian patients. The cement-screw technique, providing potential biomechanical advantages, emerges as a safe and effective solution for managing residual defects surrounding MS placement in tibial site.","Zheng Weikun, Tang Junfen, Wang Xinliang, Huang Jieying, Xiao Wende",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Female, Aged, Middle Aged, Bone Screws, Knee Prosthesis, Retrospective Studies, Tibia, Treatment Outcome, Reoperation, Follow-Up Studies, Asian People, Knee Joint, Aged, 80 and over, Prosthesis Design, East Asian People",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39966916/,"The First Clinical College of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510632, PR China.; Department of Orthopedics, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510180, PR China.; Department of Neurology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510180, PR China.; The First Clinical College of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510632, PR China. eyxiaowende@scut.edu.cn.; Department of Orthopedics, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510180, PR China. eyxiaowende@scut.edu.cn."
39958069,Systematic Review of Tibial Stems in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Tibial stems are increasingly used in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to enhance stability and reduce component load, particularly in complex cases involving obesity, severe deformity, bone loss, and inflammatory arthritis. However, limited literature exists on their indications, outcomes, and complications. This study systematically reviews the indications for tibial stems in primary TKA, the types of stems used, and their associated outcomes, including revision rates and complications. A systematic review, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to January 2024. Studies comparing stemmed and non-stemmed tibial baseplates, as well as those not comparing with non-stemmed tibial baseplates, were included. Abstracts, commentaries, and case reports were excluded. Twenty-three studies, comprising 2,073 tibial stems (30-145 mm), met the inclusion criteria. The primary indication for tibial stems was in obese patients, with variable body mass index (BMI) thresholds. The use of tibial stems, particularly short cemented stems, demonstrated favorable outcomes in complex primary TKA, including reduced rates of aseptic loosening and improved functional scores. In cases of severe varus deformity and osteoarthritis with associated tibial stress or plateau fractures, tibial stems were effective in reducing complications and improving implant stability. Short cemented tibial stems benefit complex primary TKA, especially in obese patients and those with severe deformities, preserving bone stock, optimizing load transmission, and minimizing complications. Further research is needed to establish standardized guidelines for optimal tibial stem use in primary TKA.","Supramaniam Prabu, Barmare Arshad, Chandrasekaran Siva",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39958069/,"Orthopaedics, Kuala Lumpur Hospital, Kuala Lumpur, MYS.; Orthopaedics, Werribee Mercy Hospital, Werribee, AUS.; Orthopedic Surgery, St. Vincent's Private Hospital, Werribee, AUS."
39956495,Distal Femoral Replacement for Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty in Nononcologic Indications: A Single-Institution Outcomes Study.,"Distal femoral replacement (DFR) is a salvage procedure to manage massive bone loss in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Few studies report midterm (five to 10 years) to long-term (> 10 years) outcomes of DFR for nononcologic indications. The purpose of this study was to report the implant survival of DFRs in nononcologic TKA for the entire cohort and by indication, as well as patient-reported clinical outcomes. We retrospectively identified all DFR performed for nononcologic indications from 2002 to 2021 at our institution. There were three patients who had less than a 2-year follow-up who were excluded (no revisions after DFR). There were 45 DFR included who had a mean follow-up of 6.6 years (range, 2.0 to 17.2). The mean age was 75 years (range, 53 to 94), the mean body mass index was 29.2 (range, 19.2 to 52.4), and 64.4% were women. Indications for index DFR were mechanical TKA failure (40.0%), periprosthetic fracture (33.3%), and periprosthetic joint infection (26.7%). There were 14 (31.1%) patients who underwent revision after index DFR. Reasons for the first revision were infection (seven), fracture (three), hinge dislocation (two), loosening (one), and extensor mechanism rupture (one). All DFRs were rotating hinge designs with fully cemented stems. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine all-cause revision-free Survival and patient-reported outcomes were collected. The revision-free survival for the entire cohort was 74.6% at 5 years and 60.2% at 10 years. By indication for index DFR, six of the 12 infection patients, five of the 18 mechanical failure patients, and three of the 15 fracture patients underwent revision. Differences in revision-free survival by indication were not statistically different (P = 0.221). At the final follow-up, the mean Oxford knee score was 25 (range, five to 40), with 69% patient satisfaction. A DFR for nononcological indications is associated with high revision rates. Midterm (5 to 10 years) and long-term (10 years) revision-free survival is poor and patient satisfaction is modest. Differences in survival by indication for DFR were not statistically significant. DFR remains a valuable salvage procedure, but patients need to be counseled on the expected outcome.","Sidhu Arsh, Howard Lisa C, He Jenny, Greidanus Nelson V, Masri Bassam A, Garbuz Donald S, Neufeld Michael E",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Female, Aged, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Reoperation, Retrospective Studies, Middle Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Failure, Femur, Treatment Outcome, Periprosthetic Fractures, Follow-Up Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956495/,"Department of Orthopaedics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC.; Department of Orthopaedics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC; Department of Orthopaedics, Vancouver Hip & Knee Replacement Institute, Vancouver, BC."
39956491,High Early Failure Rate of a Novel Cementless Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty.,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an accepted treatment for antero-medial osteoarthritis with low overall failure rates. In the United States, cementation remains the gold standard of implant fixation; however, multiple studies have shown potential benefits of increased survivorship with cementless fixation. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical and radiographic outcomes of a novel cementless medial UKA implant. We hypothesized that cementless UKA would perform as well as or better than cemented UKA. Clinical outcomes, including patient-reported outcome measures, were prospectively collected for 111 patients (127 knees) implanted with a novel cementless UKA from February 2021 to December 2022. Radiographic lucency zones surrounding the femoral and tibial components were evaluated from postoperative radiographs. Data were collected preoperatively and at standard postoperative intervals until final follow-up or implant revision. Revisions were necessary in 15 of 127 UKAs (11.8%) at a mean of 0.9 years (range, zero to two). The most common revision reason was aseptic loosening (12). Kaplan-Meier survival was 84.0% (95% CI [confidence interval] ± 3.98%) at 2.4 years. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement 12-month scores differed significantly between revision and nonrevision groups (61.9, 95% CI ± 13.4 versus 75.1, 95% CI ± 16.9; P = 0.01). In patients revised for aseptic loosening, 11 of 12 tibial implants had progressive radiolucent lines on prerevision imaging. Revision operative records noted minimal to no bone ingrowth on the tibial implant undersurface. This novel cementless medial UKA implant demonstrated a high rate of early revision, mostly for tibial-sided complications. Compared to nonrevised implants, revised implants had higher rates of tibial and femoral radiolucencies on postoperative radiographs as well as lower Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement 12-month scores prerevision. When recorded in the operative record, no significant bone ingrowth was seen on the porous implant surfaces.

39937239,Long-term comparative study evaluating the screw-cement construct for tibial defects in total knee arthroplasty: our experience.,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the preferred treatment for end-stage knee osteoarthritis, but challenges arise with severe angular deformities and associated tibial bone loss. The cement screw construct has emerged as a promising technique for managing these defects, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and ease of implementation. This research evaluated the clinical, functional and radiological outcome of screw-cement construct for the tibial defects in TKA. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the long-term functional outcomes and success rate of the cement screw construct in patients with significant tibial defects. Sixty-five patients (104 knees) undergoing TKA were divided into two groups: conventional TKA (Group A) and TKA with screw-cement construct (Group B). Demographic, clinical, and radiological data were collected, with a follow-up duration of at least eight years. The study revealed comparable demographic characteristics between groups. Both cohorts exhibited significant postoperative improvements in knee morphology and clinical outcomes. Group B demonstrated a higher incidence of radiolucency around the tibial tray, although no progressive complications were observed. Implant survival rates were similar between groups, with complications such as aseptic loosening and infections occurring in both without significant difference. This study emphasised the viability of the screw-cement construct for managing uncontained tibial defects during TKA, providing evidence of its efficacy, and cost-effectiveness and suggesting its potential as a standard approach for tibial defects till 20 mm.","Harna Bushu, Kapoor Anil, Arora Anil, Arya Shivali",International orthopaedics,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Female, Retrospective Studies, Aged, Bone Screws, Tibia, Middle Aged, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Treatment Outcome, Bone Cements, Knee Prosthesis, Knee Joint, Aged, 80 and over, Follow-Up Studies, Radiography, Prosthesis Failure",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39937239/,"Indus International hospital, Mohali, India. bushu.edu@gmail.com.; Paras Hospitals, Panchkula, India.; Max Super Speciality Hospital, Delhi, India.; Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, India."
39915112,What Is the Survivorship of TKA With a Twin-peg or Spikes-and-keel Cementless Implant Compared With Cemented? A Registry-based Cohort Study.,"Use of cementless TKA has grown after encouraging data from contemporary implants. Yet registry studies have shown inferior survivorship of cementless fixation when treated as a monolithic class aggregating contemporary and historic designs. Two contemporary cementless TKA designs with distantly different fixation strategies have emerged in the last 2 decades, mostly focused on tibial fixation: porous tantalum and twin-peg tibia and, more recently, porous titanium and a spikes-and-keel tibia. However, their survivorship in comparison with cemented options and between each other remains to be thoroughly delineated. (1) Is there a difference in aseptic survivorship between cementless twin-peg TKA constructs compared with cemented options? (2) Is there a difference in aseptic survivorship between cementless spikes-and-keel TKA constructs compared with cemented options? (3) Is there a difference in aseptic survivorship between cementless twin-peg TKA constructs compared with cementless spikes-and-keel TKA constructs? We conducted a cohort study using data from the Kaiser Permanente Total Joint Replacement Registry (TJRR). The TJRR prospectively collects patient, perioperative, and implant details on all patients who undergo TKA in a multiregional organization with 12 million members; patients included in the TJRR are longitudinally monitored for outcomes after TKA, and identified outcomes are manually validated through chart review. Patients who underwent primary TKA for osteoarthritis from 2009 to 2023 with a fully cementless construct of either twin-peg or spikes-and-keel, and their fully cemented options, were included (n = 136,443). TKA with hybrid or unknown fixation (2.6% [3571]), rotating or unknown mobility (0.8% [1081]), or fully constrained or unknown stability (1.1% [1549]) were excluded. The final study sample included 130,242 primary TKAs performed by 388 surgeons at 60 hospitals. Of the 125,414 patients receiving twin-peg TKAs, 9.2% who received cemented and 12.3% who received cementless were lost to follow-up. Of the 4828 patients receiving spikes-and-keel TKAs, 11.3% who received cemented versus 11.2% who received cementless were lost to follow-up. Those who terminated membership during the study period tended to be younger than those who did not (65 versus 68 years for both groups). A comparison between cementless (575 twin-peg and 1574 spikes-and-keel) versus cemented (124,839 twin-peg and 3254 spikes-and-keel) fixation was performed for each pair of analogous implants. For the twin-peg comparison, when comparing the cementless group to the cemented group, the cementless group was younger (61 versus 68 years), included more male patients (77% versus 39%), and more patients who self-reported White race (76% versus 66%). For the spikes-and-keel comparison, when comparing the cementless group to the cemented group, the cementless group was younger (65 versus 70 years), had a higher BMI (32 versus 31 kg/m 2 ), included more male patients (47% versus 29%), and had a higher proportion of minimally stabilized implants (57% versus 33%). A secondary comparison was performed between the two fully cementless fixation constructs. When comparing the twin-peg to spikes-and-keel cementless groups, the twin-peg group was younger (61 versus 65 years), included more male patients (76% versus 47%), had a higher proportion of those with an American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) classification of 1 to 2 (70% versus 44%), and had a higher proportion of posterior stabilized implants (56% versus 43%). Before outcome evaluation, propensity score weights were calculated using multivariable logistic regression models that included patient age, gender, BMI, race, smoking status, ASA classification, implant stability, and operative year as predictors of treatment assignment. After the application of propensity score weighting, all factors were balanced between the comparison groups except for male gender for the cementless versus cemented twin-peg comparison and twin-peg versus spikes-and-keel cementless comparison. Propensity score-weighted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate aseptic revision risk of the TKA construct during follow-up for all comparisons. A secondary adjustment was applied in the regression model for male gender as balance was not achieved after propensity score weighting alone. In the adjusted analysis for the twin-peg group, cementless fixation had a higher risk of aseptic revision compared with cemented fixation (HR 2.13 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30 to 3.50]; p = 0.003). In the adjusted analysis for the spikes-and-keel group, no difference in aseptic revision risk was observed between cementless and cemented fixation (HR 0.94 [95% CI 0.56 to 1.58]; p = 0.82). When directly comparing cementless twin-peg to spikes-and-keel, twin-peg was associated with a higher risk of aseptic revision compared with spikes-and-keel (HR 2.56 [95% CI 1.13 to 5.79]; p = 0.02). In this large registry-based cohort study, no cementless TKA construct was associated with better implant survivorship compared with their cemented counterpart options. Cementless fixation may continue to evolve and improve, as cementless spikes-and-keel performed better than twin-peg. But given that reliable results have been observed over longer periods with established cemented TKA, at present, the prudent choice remains cemented TKA. Future recommendations may change but require a demonstrable advantage in implant survivorship and outcomes of future cementless constructs over cemented fixation in carefully designed studies.

39898284,The Impact of Cementing Techniques on Implant Longevity in Relation to Keel Length in Persona and NexGen Knee Arthroplasty: A Comprehensive Study.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of our modified cementing technique in reducing the rate of aseptic tibial loosening focusing on its relationship with keel length. Every participant who underwent primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between August 2014 and September 2022 with a minimum of 4-year follow-up using 1 of 3 implants were included: Persona + conventional cementing technique; Persona + modified cementing technique; and NexGen LPS-Flex. The modifications applied include better preparation of the bone surfaces and the cancellous bone cavities, pressurizing the cement and interstitial fluid suction at the same time, applying a layer of cement on the surfaces of the tibia and implant, and immobilizing the limb. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to estimate survivorship. A total of 988 of 1039 primary TKAs (95.1%) were included with follow-up of 89.26 ± 7.32 months. Twenty eight (2.83%) TKA required revisions due to aseptic tibial loosening; 3 (1.1%) in the NexGen group, 21 (6.9%) in the conventionally cemented Persona group, and 4 (0.9%) within the modified cemented Persona group. Aseptic loosening occurred at a mean of 69.00 ± 2.65, 34.57 ± 22.90, and 68.50 ± 3.42, respectively. Survivorship for aseptic loosening was 98.9%, 93.1%, and 99.1% at 8 years, respectively. The revision rate for early (during the first 24 months) aseptic loosening was 4.6% in the conventionally cemented Persona group. No early aseptic loosening reported in other 2 groups. In conclusion, meticulous cementing techniques can reduce the rate of tibial loosening in shorter keel designs.","Vaziri Arash Sharafat, Tahmasebi Mohammad Naghi, Hadi Hoseinali, Javidmehr Sina, Keyhani Sohrab, Vahdati Zahra, Nematian Hossein, Farahmand Yalda",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39898284/,"Center of Orthopedic Trans-Disciplinary Applied Research (COTAR), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Division of Knee Surgery, Department of Orthopedics, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Orthopedic Department, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Sina Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Akhtar Orthopedic Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Center for Orthopedic Trans-Disciplinary Applied Research, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."
39884479,"A ""1.5-Stage"" Spacer Construct Using Revision Components for the Management of Periprosthetic Joint Infection of the Knee.","The two-stage surgical protocols used for the treatment of periprosthetic joint infection following total knee arthroplasty are associated with marked patient morbidity. As such, alternatives, such as durable ""1.5-stage"" spacer constructs, have gained popularity. We sought to describe the outcomes of a novel ""1.5-stage"" spacer construct utilizing revision stemmed-tibia implants. Patients who underwent a ""1.5-stage"" for the management of a knee periprosthetic joint infectionat our institution were screened for inclusion. A ""1.5-stage"" was defined as a spacer placed with the intent of not performing a second stage, without the use of press-fit stems or cemented intramedullary fixation as is often done during a single-stage protocol. Procedures were categorized into two groups based on construct type: (1) hand-made constructs utilizing all-polyethylene tibial components; or (2) constructs utilizing stemmed-revision components precoated with cement before insertion. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and surgical details were collected and reported. The two-year Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for all-cause revision, revision for spacer loosening, and revision due to infection recurrence were reported. In total, 46 ""1.5-stage"" procedures were identified, including 12 handmade and 34 stemmed-revision constructs. The stemmed-revision cohort was less likely to undergo reoperation for any reason (17.6 versus 50.0%, P = 0.028) or a revision for spacer loosening (0.0 versus 25.0%, P = 0.003) compared to the hand-made cohort. There were no differences with respect to infection recurrence or time to revision. The 2-year survival from revision for loosening was higher in the stemmed cohort compared to the handmade cohort though not statistically different (100%, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 2.5 to 100.0 versus 72.9%, 95% CI: 26.3 to 96.6%, P = 0.330). A ""1.5-stage"" spacer construct using stemmed-revision components was associated with promising short-term results. Durable spacer constructs may be a viable option for select patients; however, longer-term follow-up is needed to identify patients who stand to benefit the most from this technique.","Heckmann Nathanael D, Biedermann Brett M, Richardson Mary K, Chen Matthew S, Gettleman Brandon S, Liu Kevin C, Christ Alexander B, Longjohn Donald B, Oakes Daniel A",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Prosthesis-Related Infections, Reoperation, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Female, Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies, Aged, 80 and over, Prosthesis Design, Knee Joint, Treatment Outcome, Prosthesis Failure",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39884479/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California."
39877987,Using three-zone flexible cones at the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction may avoid the need for distal femoral replacement: The floating cone technique.,"Distal femoral replacement (DFR) with megaprostheses is a salvage revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) procedure indicated in cases with massive bone defects in the distal femur. As long as these implants achieve fixation only in the diaphysis, the high aseptic loosening rate reported in some series is probably related to a lack of rotational stability. Two patients with extensive distal femoral bone defects with preservation of the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction underwent rTKA. Instead of performing a DFR with megaprostheses, partially impacted three-zone cones and standard cemented hinged implants were used with the aim of achieving better rotational stability. Both patients showed good evolution after a 12-month follow up. Clinical findings included a normal range of motion (0-100°) without any instability and preserved ability for full weight-bearing ambulation. No signs of prosthetic loosening appeared in the X-rays during follow up. To our knowledge, this was the first time a single partially anchored three-zone cone was used in massive metaphyseal femoral defects. It is an implant-dependent technique that additionally requires the preservation of the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction, but may avoid the use of megaprostheses in some cases.","Ferrer-Banús Marc, Monfort-Mira Montserrat, Sabater-Martos Marta, Boadas-Gironès Laia, Chimeno-Pigrau Clara, Martínez-Pastor Juan Carlos",The Knee,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Femur, Prosthesis Design, Knee Prosthesis, Aged, Female, Reoperation, Male, Range of Motion, Articular, Middle Aged, Knee Joint, Diaphyses",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39877987/,"Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

Five individuals were prospectively treated with 2-stage revision using spacers made by this mold. Clinical assessment was conducted during and after implantation using the WOMAC Score, Oxford knee score, and range of motion (ROM). The results showed that the ROM increased by an average of 35 degrees during the spacer stage, with an average ROM of 100 degrees. Furthermore, there was an average gain of 85.2 points in the Knee Society Score and an average rise of 22.8 points in the total WOMAC scores. This approach had a similar effect on improving infection, motion performance, and patients' satisfaction with metal articular molds but without high-technology equipment and low-cost price. Therefore, this method could be applied to any operating room that performs arthroplasty surgery.","Ganji Reza, Armide Negin, Younessi Heravi Mohamad Amin",The archives of bone and joint surgery,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39850927/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, School of Medicine, Imam Ali Hospital, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran.; Student research committee, School of Medicine, Imam Ali Hospital, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran.; Department of Medical Physics and Radiology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."
39848451,Mechanical Integrity Assessment of Polymethylmethacrylate Bone Cement Incorporating Local Anesthetics: Implications for Joint Arthroplasty.,"Effective management of postsurgical pain following arthroplasty remains a challenge, lacking a definitive gold standard. As most knee and hip arthroplasties are cemented or hybrid, we used the property of bone cement as a drug carrier and added powdered local anesthetics (lidocaine hydrochloride and bupivacaine hydrochloride) to the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as analgesics. However, the addition of drugs to bone cement may compromise its mechanical properties, necessitating a thorough analysis. Our objective was to assess the impact of added local anesthetics on the mechanical properties of PMMA bone cement. Mechanical properties, including compressive strength, bending modulus, and bending strength, were evaluated following the procedure set by the International Organization for Standardization 5833-2002 and the American Society for Testing and Materials F451-1 standards. There were three of the following study groups compared: PMMA, PMMA with lidocaine hydrochloride, and PMMA with bupivacaine hydrochloride. Significant differences were observed between groups in compressive and bending strength, but not in bending modulus. Despite these differences, the mean compressive strength and bending modulus of all groups and the mean bending strength of the lidocaine group surpassed the minimum values set by the International Organization for Standardization 5833-2002 and American Society for Testing and Materials F 451-08 standards for acrylic bone cement. However, the bupivacaine group fell short of the minimum bending strength value. The addition of powdered local anesthetics to PMMA affects its mechanical properties, specifically compressive and bending strength, without compromising the bending modulus. While differences were noted, all groups surpassed the minimum standards for compressive strength and bending modulus. However, the bupivacaine group did not meet the minimum bending strength requirement. This highlights the importance of considering mechanical properties when incorporating drugs into bone cement for implant fixation.","Monfort-Mira Montserrat, Balaguer-Castro Mariano, Jornet-Gibert Montsant, Cito Salvatore, De la Flor-López Silvia, Torner Pere",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Polymethyl Methacrylate, Bone Cements, Anesthetics, Local, Compressive Strength, Materials Testing, Lidocaine, Bupivacaine, Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39848451/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, Hospital Clínic Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain."
39819483,Floating-embedded stems reduce tibial stress shielding in total knee revision arthroplasty.,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common orthopaedic procedures and the number of patients which undergo TKA will continue to rise in the coming years. Consecutively, the number of necessary revision surgeries will increase. One of the main reasons for revision surgery is aseptic loosening because of a so-called stress-shielding effect. Typically, revision of a primary TKA is done from a bicondylar surface replacement to a stem-anchored prosthesis, which, due to higher stress-shielding, have a shorter survival time than non-stem-anchored systems. Similar to endoprosthetic treatment in pediatric tumor orthopedics, non-ingrown cementless stems can be used. The study aim was to investigate whether this concept can also be applied to reduce stress-shielding in the tibial metaphysis after revision TKA in adults. Six tibial biomechanical bone with stemmed tibial TKA components were implanted using surface cementing and a floating-embedded stem or classic full cementing. After implantation, axial force was applied in such a way that the same load was generated as during walking. Two high-resolution cameras and illumination spots were used to record changes on the bone surface circumferentially in three regions of interest and from three different views. With regard to the fixation method, a significant difference could be demonstrated in the metaphyseal and in the middle region around the stem (p < 0.001). At the tip of the stems, the reduction of strain energy density showed a stress shielding reduction for the floating-stemmed models in two of three views (ventromedial p = 0.002, lateral p = 0.398, and dorsal: p = 0.027). In revision surgery after TKA, the use of floating-embedded, uncemented stems without bony ingrowth shows significant reduction of metaphyseal stress-shielding within the proximal tibia. This technique could be a viable alternative to prevent early aseptic loosening and should be examined in future in-vivo studies.","Schaefer Dominic, Barsumyan Artur, Roshanghias Kambiz, Graw Jan Adriaan, Soost Christian, Richter Wolfgang, Knoche Jonas, Ohrndorf Arne, Burchard Rene",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Reoperation, Tibia, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Design, Male, Stress, Mechanical, Female, Aged, Prosthesis Failure, Middle Aged, Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39819483/,"Department of Engineering, School of Science, University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany.; University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany.; Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, University of Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.; Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Ulm University Hospital, Ulm, Germany.; Department of Statistics, School of Economic Disciplines, University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany.; University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany. burcharr@staff.uni-marburg.de.; Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, University of Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany. burcharr@staff.uni-marburg.de.; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery, Lahn-Dill-Kliniken, Dillenburg, Germany. burcharr@staff.uni-marburg.de.; Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, University of Giessen and Marburg, Marburg Lahn-Dill-Kliniken, Rotebergstr. 2, 35683, Dillenburg, Germany. burcharr@staff.uni-marburg.de."

She was afebrile and able to walk with a stick. Physical examination revealed moderate effusion. Radiographs showed posteriorly extruded cement, while computed tomography confirmed the absence of implant loosening but was unable to adequately visualize the adjacent soft tissues due to metallic artifacts. Ultrasound identified posterior cement extrusion beyond the femoral component, causing a delamination tear of the posterior capsule and indentation on the medial gastrocnemius. Knee arthrocentesis yielded 60 mL of blood-stained fluid with unremarkable analysis, and the patient reported improvement following the procedure. To our knowledge, this is the first report to highlight the unique role of ultrasound in detailing the anatomy of extruded cement and its impact on adjacent soft tissues following knee replacement.

It is also examined whether cemented fixation offers any superiority over hybrid fixation regarding implant survival, clinical function, imaging analysis and complication rates. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on five databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, Medline and Cochrane). Articles were evaluated according to levels of evidence (LoE). Retrospective studies were analysed with risk of bias in nonrandomised studies of interventions (Robins-I) and randomised controlled trials with risk of bias 2 (RoB-2). This review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database. Meta-analysis was performed using R software, with <i>p</i> < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Data from 12 comparative studies with 1303 patients (1352 rTKAs) were analysed. Survival rates of hybrid and cemented fixations were comparable, with a significant trend favouring hybrid fixation (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Infection and aseptic loosening were the most common causes of failure. Radiographic failure rates showed no significant differences between fixation methods (<i>p</i> = 0.4). Meta-analysis indicated better results with hybrid fixation, although not statistically significant (KSS functional <i>p</i> = 0.15; KSS clinical <i>p</i> = 0.5). High heterogeneity was observed due to variations in patient characteristics and surgical strategies. Both hybrid and cemented fixation techniques achieve satisfactory clinical results in rTKA, with hybrid fixation demonstrating an overall lower failure rate. The choice of fixation method must be tailored to individual patient characteristics and surgical considerations. Further high-quality randomised trials are needed to refine these results and optimise fixation strategies to improve patient outcomes.

39776207,Evaluation and refinement of thresholds for early migration of total knee replacements as an estimator of late aseptic loosening: an updated systematic review of RSA and survival studies.,"This study updates 2 parallel systematic reviews and meta-analyses from 2012, which established the 1-year radiostereometric (RSA) migration thresholds for tibial components of total knee replacements (TKR) based on the risk of late revision for aseptic loosening from survival studies. The primary aim of this study was to determine the (mis)categorization rate of the 2012 thresholds using the updated review as a validation dataset. Secondary aims were evaluation of 6-month migration, mean continuous (1- to 2-year) migration, and fixation-specific thresholds for tibial component migration. One review comprised early migration data, measured by maximum total point motion (MTPM), from RSA studies, while the other focused on revision rates for aseptic loosening of tibial components from survival studies. Studies were matched based on prosthesis, fixation (i.e., cemented and uncemented, and uncemented with screw fixation), and insert (PFI). For the primary aim, newly included study group combinations were compared with the 2012 RSA thresholds to determine the (mis)categorization rate. For the secondary aims, new thresholds were determined based on revision rates for any reason in national registries (5-year < 3%, 10-year < 5%, 15-year < 6.5%). After matching studies on PFI, a total of 157 survival and 82 RSA studies were included, comprising 504 study group combinations, 51 different PFIs, and 186,974 TKRs. We found that the 2012 thresholds were valid, with a misclassification rate of 0.5% at 5 and 0.3% at 10 years. Mean continuous migration could not be used to identify safe or unsafe implants. For cemented TKR, the 6-month mean MTPM was acceptable below 0.30 mm and unacceptable above 1.10 mm. For uncemented TKR, it was acceptable below 1.10 mm and unacceptable above 1.55 mm. The updated data reaffirm the 2012 RSA thresholds, confirming their validity in estimating revision risks for tibial component aseptic loosening. The newly proposed fixation-specific 6-month migration thresholds were found to be reliable for early identification of unsafe TKR designs, while 1- to 2-year mean continuous migration data were found not to be reliable for this purpose. These findings support and refine the migration thresholds to improve the evidence-based introduction of new TKR systems.","Puijk Raymond, Singh Jiwanjot, Puijk Rowan H, Laende Elise K, Plevier José W M, Nolte Peter A, Pijls Bart G C W",Acta orthopaedica,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Foreign-Body Migration, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Failure, Radiostereometric Analysis, Reoperation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39776207/,"Department of Orthopaedics, Spaarne Gasthuis, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands.

39762981,Tibial stem extension versus standard configuration in primary cemented total knee arthroplasty: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"In order to increase the stability of tibial component in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), intramedullary stem extensions (SE) have been developed. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to address the critical knowledge gap on post-operative outcomes and complications rate comparison between tibial component with SE compared to the tibial component standard configuration (SC) in primary cemented TKA. We conducted a comprehensive search of online databases, including Pubmed, Embase, ISI Web of science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus, using the following MeSH terms, (total knee arthroplasty) OR (TKA) OR (total knee replacement) AND (Tibial stem) OR (stem extension) OR (long stem). We included clinical studies that compared the tibial SE with no tibial stem (standard configuration) in primary cemented TKA. The important exclusion criteria were studies on revision (secondary) TKA, un-cemented arthroplasty, high level constrained implants, TKA with tibial augment & tibial bone graft, TKA with femoral stems, studies on short tibial keel (shorter than SC), without any tibial keel, studies with less than 12 months of follow-up. Knee Society Score (KSS) functional and clinical scores were considered as clinical outcomes along with tibial loosening and implant survival rate. The retrieved studies were assessed for methodological quality using Cochrane Collaborations tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials (ROB) and Cochrane Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools. Weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using random-effects meta-analysis taking into account for heterogeneity. A total of 223,743 patients (223,766 knees) from 15 articles were included. The risk of tibial aseptic loosening is 54% lower on average in SE group in comparison with SC group (RR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.74), which is more notable among obese class I patients (RR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.78), but not significantly different among obese class II patients (RR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.19 to 1.78). KSS functional and clinical score increased 3.85 score (95% CI: 1.52 to 6.18), and 1,24 scores (95% CI: - 0.22 to 2.70) among patients in SE group, respectively. The survival rate was 1.04 times greater in the SE group. There was no notable difference in terms of knee deformity (hip-knee-ankle angle) correction, all cause secondary procedure, and complications rate between the two groups. The meta-analysis of post-operative functional scores and tibial loosening rate indicates a preference for tibial SE over the SC in primary cemented TKA. Some studies were rated as having a fair to critical risk of bias during the quality assessment. To strengthen the evidence and improve the applicability of our findings in clinical practice, future high-quality studies are required.","Heidari Arash, Ebrahimzadeh Mohammad H, Daliri Mahla, Moradi Ali, Sahebi Mahdieh, Sadeghi Masoumeh",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,"Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Humans, Tibia, Knee Prosthesis, Bone Cements, Prosthesis Failure, Prosthesis Design, Treatment Outcome, Postoperative Complications, Cementation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39762981/,"Orthopedic Research Center, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.; Department of Epidemiology, School of Health, Mashhad University of Medical Science, Mashhad, Iran.

39743933,Association between postoperative zonal fixation of hybrid tibial components in revision total knee arthroplasty and subsequent aseptic loosening.,"Tibial fixation in revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) can present surgical challenges. It has been suggested that appropriate fixation in at least two of the three anatomical zones (epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis) is essential for implant survival. However, supporting clinical data are lacking. In this retrospective case-control study, we investigated the relationship between zonal fixation of hybrid rTKA tibial components and re-revision total knee arthroplasty for aseptic loosening (rrTKA-AL). All consecutive rTKAs with hybrid tibial components (May 2006 to December 2020) were screened for subsequent rrTKA-AL. A control group was randomly selected from the remaining cohort. Postoperative radiographs of rTKAs were scored in random order by three blinded observers for zonal fixation in the epiphysis (bone resection level below, at, or above fibular head; 0 to 2), metaphysis (number of sufficiently cemented zones; 0 to 4), and diaphysis (canal filling ratio (CFR); %). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to quantify the agreement between observers. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between zonal fixation and rrTKA-AL. Overall, 33 patients underwent a further rrTKA-AL from a total of 1,173 rTKAs where hybrid tibial components (2.8%) were used. Patients requiring rrTKA-AL had a significantly lower epiphyseal bone resection level (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.76; p = 0.006), lower number of adequately cemented zones (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.79; p = 0.004), but no difference in CFR (p = 0.858). Furthermore, patients needing rrTKA-AL had more frequently previous revisions (p = 0.047), a higher rate of a prior use of a stemmed tibial component (p = 0.011), and a higher Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute classification (p < 0.001). Agreement of zonal fixation between observers was good (ICC 0.79 to 0.87). Patients in need of subsequent rrTKA-AL had lower epiphyseal bone resection levels and a lower number of sufficiently metaphyseal cemented zones following rTKA. These results emphasize the importance of appropriate metaphyseal fixation at rTKA. With this information, orthopaedic surgeons can identify patients at greater risk for rrTKA-AL and optimize their surgical technique in revision knee arthroplasty surgery.","van Laarhoven Simon N, Nota Sjoerd P F T, van Hellemondt Gijs G, Schreurs Berend W, Wymenga Ate B, Heesterbeek Petra J C",The bone & joint journal,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Reoperation, Female, Retrospective Studies, Male, Prosthesis Failure, Aged, Tibia, Case-Control Studies, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Aged, 80 and over",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39743933/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Sint Maartenskliniek, Nijmegen, Netherlands.; Department of Orthopaedics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands.; Department of Research, Sint Maartenskliniek, Nijmegen, Netherlands."

The current range includes short-length options for various offsets, but less is known about the performance of these stems. The aim of this study was to compare the survival of short-length stems with standard-length Exeter stems. A systematic review of all studies reporting the use of short-length Exeter stems in primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) was undertaken. Survival data, the indication for revision, and patient-reported outcomes were gathered from observational and randomized studies. Studies based on registry data were analyzed separately. The review included nine studies which covered a total of 2,190 short stems. The mean follow-up was 6.4 years (2 to 12) with an all-cause survival of 95.4%. When revisions due to aseptic acetabular loosening were excluded, the survival was 97.7%. Four stems fractured (0.18%). The mean Oxford Hip Score improved from 18.29 (1.33 to 21.6) preoperatively to 41.59 (32.9 to 43.4) at final follow-up. Three studies used data from national registries. A total of 25,895 short stems (offset ≤ 35.5 mm) were used compared with 336,218 standard-length stems. In these studies, short stems had a hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause survival of 1.19 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.43) with a rate of revision per 1,000 component-years of 0.037 compared with 0.035 for standard-length stems. One study from the New Zealand Joint Registry divided short stems into standard and small offset groups. Standard offset short stems (≥ 37.5 mm) had a 0.84 HR (95% CI 0.38 to 1.88) while small offset short stems (≤ 35.5 mm) had a 1.6 HR compared with standard stems (95% CI 1.3 to 1.98). Short Exeter stems perform well and are a safe femoral component in primary THA, according to the current literature.

This was complicated by implant breakage and non-union. She subsequently had implant removal and a right distal femur replacement (DFR) surgery 2 years prior to presentation. A year after the DFR surgery, she began to experience ""start-up"" pain, instability around the knee and difficulty with walking without support. A clinical and radiologic diagnosis of aseptic loosening of the distal femur megaprosthesis was made and she was offered a revision DFR surgery which also failed due to poor cementing technique, bone loss at the proximal femur, and severe osteoporosis. Patient ended up with a right total femur replacement to salvage the limb. She had improved Lower Extremity Functional Score of 27 after 12-month follow-up. TFR is a viable salvage procedure for severely compromised femur and/or significant bone loss from multiple non-oncological surgeries of the femur.","Ugbeye Michael Ebiyon, Alatishe Kehinde Adesola, Lawal Wakeel Olaide",Journal of the West African College of Surgeons,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39735818/,"Arthroplasty Unit, Orthopaedic and Trauma Department, National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, Nigeria.; Orthopaedic and Trauma Department, National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, Nigeria."
39731597,Cementless fixation in total knee arthroplasty: current evidence and future perspective.,"Cementless fixation plays an increasing role in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The objective of this review article is to analyze functional outcomes and survivorship of cementless TKA. A comprehensive literature search for studies reviewing the outcome and survivorship of cementless TKA was conducted. This search was based on the PRISMA 2020 guidelines using PubMed, Medline, and Embase. The included studies were screened by two independent observers. From 2010 to 2022, fifteen studies were included. Eleven studies compared cementless and cemented TKA. Four studies only covered cementless implants. Survivorship and functional outcomes of cementless TKA are at least comparable to those of cemented implants. With improvement in manufacturing, and surgical tools for more precise delivery, such as robotic assisted TKA and 3D-printed implants, one can expect increase in usage of cementless TKA, due to a more biological fixation, better survivorship, and outcomes.","Haslhofer David J, Kraml Nikolaus, Stadler Christian, Gotterbarm Tobias, Klotz Matthias C, Klasan Antonio",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Design",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39731597/,"Department for Orthopedics and Traumatology, Kepler University Hospital GmbH, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Krankenhausstrasse 9, 4020 Linz and Altenberger Strasse 69, 4040, Linz, Austria. david.haslhofer@gmx.at.; Department for Orthopedics and Traumatology, Kepler University Hospital GmbH, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Krankenhausstrasse 9, 4020 Linz and Altenberger Strasse 69, 4040, Linz, Austria.; Marienhospital Soest, Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery, Widumgasse 5, 59494, Soest, Germany.; Faculty of Medicine, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenberger Strasse 69, 4040, Linz, Austria.; Department for Orthopedics and Traumatology, AUVA Graz, Göstinger Straße 24, 8020, Graz, Austria."
39720228,Robotic-Assisted Conversion of Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty to Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) procedures have become much more common in the United States in recent years, with >40,000 UKAs performed annually<sup>1</sup>. However, it is estimated that 10% to 40% of UKAs fail and thus require conversion to total knee arthroplasty (TKA)<sup>2-5</sup>. In the field of total joint arthroplasty, robotic-assisted surgeries have demonstrated advantages such as better accuracy and precision of implant positioning and improved restoration of a neutral mechanical axis<sup>6-9</sup>. These advantages may be useful in UKA to TKA conversion surgeries, as the use of robotic assistance may result in improved bone preservation. Robotic-assisted TKA is performed with the patient in the supine position, under spinal anesthesia, and with use of a tourniquet. A limited incision is made approximately 1 cm medial to a standard midline incision, through the previous UKA incision. A medial parapatellar arthrotomy and partial synovectomy are performed. Array pins are placed in a standard fashion: intra-incisional in the femoral diaphysis and extra-incisional in the distal tibial diaphysis. Femoral and tibial bone registration is performed, along with functional knee balancing to adjust implant positioning. The robotic arm-assisted system is then utilized to achieve the planned bone resections. After completing all bone cuts, trial components are inserted. Trial reduction is then performed, and knee extension, stability, and range of motion are assessed. The final implant is cemented into place. We utilize a cruciate-retaining TKA implant. No augments are required. An alternative treatment option is manual UKA to TKA conversion. Robotic-assisted conversion of UKA to TKA is especially useful for patients requiring bone preservation. For example, 1 case series found that the use of robotic-assisted conversion of UKA to TKA resulted in a decreased use of augments and a smaller average polyethylene insert thickness compared with manual conversion. Furthermore, mechanical bone loss may occur secondary to implant loosening. Thus, in patients with aseptic loosening, robotic-assisted conversion of UKA to TKA may be useful<sup>10</sup>. Results of robotic-assisted conversion of UKA to TKA have thus far been excellent. In a study of 4 patients undergoing robotic-assisted conversion of UKA to TKA, all patients experienced uneventful recoveries without any need for subsequent re-revision<sup>10</sup>. In a case report of a robotic-assisted conversion of UKA to TKA, the patient was pain-free at both 6 months and 1 year postoperatively, with a range of motion of 0° to 120° at 6 months and 0° to 130° at 1 year, and excellent component alignment on radiographs at 1 year<sup>11</sup>. In another case report, the patient had full range of motion and a normal, painless gait at 1 year postoperatively<sup>12</sup>. When comparing manual versus robotic-assisted conversion, 1 study found no difference in postoperative range of motion or complications among the 28 patients assessed<sup>13</sup>. Ensure accurate soft-tissue balancing prior to implant removal and osseous resection.Augments can easily be cut by executing the initial cut, then moving the resection depth either 5 or 10 mm deeper. The cut is then performed only in the compartment that needs an augment. Augment cutting is usually performed in a stepwise fashion to avoid excessive resection in the other compartments in order to preserve native bone.Having revision implants with increased constraint and metaphyseal fixation available is important during these cases because, as in any revision surgery, unexpected events can lead to the need for other implant choices.

39717839,Double-Butter: A Cementation Technique That Significantly Reduces Lipid Contamination of the Tibial Baseplate in Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Aseptic loosening is the most common aseptic failure modality following total knee arthroplasty. Recent literature suggests that the implant-cement interface is the ""weak-link"" in fixation and lipid contamination may drive this debonding pattern. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if the ""double-butter"" technique would significantly decrease lipid contamination of the tibial tray. Transparent acrylic models of 7 different tibial baseplates were created to allow for direct visualization of fluid contamination of the implant-cement interface during experimental cementation. Three cementation techniques were then employed in triplicate for each implant: coating only the tibia (""single butter"") and coating of the tibia and baseplate (with and without keel included; ""double-butter""). A dye was added centrally to simulate lipid contamination. After each trial, the degree of implant-cement contamination was calculated. Standard statistical analyses were conducted. With the double-butter technique, there was a significant reduction in contamination for all studied implant designs (range: 0%-7%; <i>P</i> < .05) and contamination was eliminated when the entire implant was coated prior to implantation. The single-butter technique resulted in contamination of 16%-43% of the tibial undersurface. There were significant differences in percent contamination between component designs (<i>P</i> < .05). Cementation technique and implant design each influenced baseplate lipid contamination. While significant differences were noted between keel geometries, we found that the double-butter technique effectively eliminated baseplate contamination, even in the most susceptible designs in this study. We therefore advocate for the incorporation of the double-butter technique to limit lipid contamination and potentially reduce aseptic tibial loosening.","Wilson Jacob M, Mika Aleksander P, Gilbert William W, Mason J Bohannon, Polkowski Gregory G, Martin J Ryan",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39717839/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.; OrthoCarolina Hip and Knee Center, Charlotte, NC, USA."
39713555,Safe tibial subsidence pattern of a medial pivot knee. An RSA study.,"Micromotion analysis predicts component fixation survival in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) but a paucity of literature exists for medial pivot designs. This clinical study examined the tibial component micromotion in a second-generation medial pivot TKA. This prospective single-center clinical cohort trial involved 35 patients with a mean patient age of 71 years. Operations were performed by one experienced arthroplasty surgeon using the Saiph implant (MatOrtho). All patients received fully cemented fixation with patella resurfacing. Other variables were standardized. Radiostereometric Analysis was performed at 6 weeks, 12 and 24 months to monitor tibial component behavior. Benign, minor micromotion was shown with cemented fixation. At 12 months median subsidence was 0.04 mm and Median Maximal Total Point Motion was 0.44 mm. At 24 months the median subsidence was 0.02 mm and Median Maximal Total Point Motion was 0.46 mm. No tibial components were revised. Low degrees of subsidence and Maximum Total Point Motion imply stable fixation of these medial pivot implants and high patient satisfaction was achieved. This is consistent with favorable long-term performance.","Nivbrant Nils Oscar, Yates Piers J",Journal of orthopaedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39713555/,"Fremantle Hospital, Orthopaedics Research Foundation of WA Alma St, 6160, Fremantle, WA, Australia."
39710212,Aseptic Tibial Loosening Is Associated With Thickness of the Cement: A Radiographic Case-Control Study.,"The cementation technique is crucial for achieving adequate fixation and optimal survivorship in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The thickness of the cement at the tibial bone-implant surface may be related to aseptic tibial loosening. However, to date, no studies have demonstrated a direct association between cement thickness and rates of aseptic tibial loosening. We performed a retrospective review to identify 28,327 primary cemented TKAs with at least 2 years of follow-up at an academic health system from 2013 to 2021. A total of 115 cases underwent revision surgery for aseptic tibial loosening. Cases where the implant was recalled specifically for loosening (n = 23) were excluded. The remaining 92 aseptic tibial loosening cases were 2:1 propensity score matched and implant matched to control patients who did not have tibial loosening. There were two independent reviewers who then measured the thickness of the cement interface in 10 locations along the bone-implant interface from initial postoperative radiographs. The averages of the reviewers' measurements were calculated and then compared using independent t-tests. Aseptic tibial loosening cases involving implant A tibial baseplate (n = 75) had significantly thinner cement interfaces than matched controls at all the 10 locations measured. Aseptic loosening cases involving implant B (n = 17) also displayed a thinner cement interface than matched controls in all locations, but this result was only statistically significant at the medial baseplate, medial keel, lateral keel, anterior keel, and posterior baseplate. In two widely used TKA systems, tibial aseptic loosening was associated with significantly thinner cement interfaces when compared to propensity-matched controls in two different implant types. Further prospective studies are needed to identify the optimal keel preparation and design as well as minimal cement interface thickness to avoid implant loosening.

39708185,The impact of pathogen sensitivity to antibiotics loaded in cement on the number of revisions and costs in the treatment of periprosthetic knee infection.,"This study aims to evaluate the impact of the pathogen's sensitivity to the loaded antibiotics on infection resolution, the number of revisions, and the associated costs in patients undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) due to PJI. We reviewed the treatment and follow-up processes of 61 patients who underwent rTKA for late-stage PJI following primary total knee arthroplasty in our clinic. The study included 11 patients in the resistant group and 50 in the sensitive group in line with the power analysis results. Patients' demographic characteristics and comorbidities were recorded. All patients received dual antibiotic-loaded cement. Microbiological examinations of patients were analyzed, and the number of revision surgeries each patient underwent was determined. We analyzed all surgeries related to infection treatment, including open irrigation, debridement, polyethylene exchange, implant extractions, antibiotic-loaded cement spacer placements, spacer changes, and debridements, and the implantation of revision prostheses, including tumor prostheses. The total number of surgeries each patient underwent was recorded. We also reviewed hospital system records of total protocol costs during patient admissions. Of 61 patients undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) for periprosthetic joint infection, 11 had antibiotic-resistant infections and 50 had antibiotic-sensitive infections. The groups had similar demographics. Polymicrobial infections were more frequent in the resistant group (p = 0.017), with all resistant cases showing gentamicin resistance and two showing teicoplanin resistance. The resistant group required more surgeries (average 3.91 ± 2.7 vs. 2.34 ± 1.3, p = 0.043) compared to the sensitive group, with teicoplanin resistance doubling revision surgeries (p = 0.005). Costs were similar between groups, averaging $6536.96. Gram-negative infections led to more revisions (p = 0.013). Polymicrobial infections did not significantly affect the number of surgeries or costs compared to single strain infections. Our study demonstrates that in rTKA surgeries using dual antibiotic-loaded bone cement, infections caused by antibiotic-resistant microorganisms are more challenging and time-consuming to treat. This underscores the necessity of exploring new methods to enhance local efficacy by loading cement with antibiotics based on specific pathogen culture and sensitivity results, while also providing clinical evidence of the effectiveness of current treatment methods against sensitive microorganisms.

Consecutive patients who underwent unilateral primary TKA were prospectively enrolled. The implants were fixed using gentamicin-impregnated bone cement, and after arthrotomy closure, 1000 mg of vancomycin suspended in 25 mL of normal saline was directly injected into the joint. Peripheral venous blood and drain fluid samples were collected 2, 8, and 24 h postoperatively. The serum and intra-articular concentrations of vancomycin and gentamicin were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry within 24 h. Clinical data reflecting renal and liver function were recorded preoperatively, and at 24 and 72 h postoperatively. A total of 100 patients were included. At 2, 8, and 24 h postoperatively, the serum vancomycin concentration was 7.0 ± 2.0, 5.7 ± 1.8, and 3.6 ± 1.4 µg/mL, respectively, while the intra-articular concentration was 468.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 286.0 to 774.8), 139.5 (IQR 52.0 to 295.3), and 34.4 (IQR 22.2 to 56.8) µg/mL, respectively; 33.2 (IQR 19.5 to 80.5) mg vancomycin was lost in drainage fluid at 24 h postoperatively. For gentamicin, the overall intra-articular concentration was 70.4 (IQR 35.4 to 109.2), 33.8 (IQR 17.8 to 73.9), and 21.1 (IQR 12.2 to 36.0) µg/mL at 2, 8, and 24 h postoperatively, respectively, with an undetectable serum concentration. No cases of acute renal injury, liver injury, ototoxicity, or anaphylaxis were observed. Intra-articular injection of 1000 mg vancomycin after arthrotomy closure combined with gentamicin-impregnated bone cement provided a therapeutic intra-articular concentration while avoiding systemic toxicity over the initial 24 h after primary TKA. Therefore, intra-articular vancomycin administration may offer a safer alternative to intravenous antibiotics, reducing systemic toxicity; however, further large-scale studies are necessary.

39666005,Comparison of postoperative blood loss in cementless and cemented total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review.,"With the advancement of porous surface processing technology, cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has once again garnered attention. Cementless TKA lacks cement sealing, raising concerns regarding potential blood loss. Recently, patient blood management (PBM) protocols have been introduced to mitigate postoperative blood loss and transfusions. In this systematic review, we aimed to address whether cementless TKA leads to increased blood loss and transfusion rates as compared with cemented TKA. Additionally, we explored the impact of contemporary PBM protocols on post-TKA hemodynamics. This systematic review included prospective randomized trials and retrospective studies that compared blood loss and PBM between cementless and cemented TKA. A comprehensive literature search for publications from 1980 onwards was conducted using databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Furthermore, we conducted a thorough examination of the bibliographies of all relevant articles that were retrieved. Studies that met our inclusion criteria were assessed carefully for pertinent data. This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-views and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and was registered in the PROSPERO register (CRD42024507236). A total of twelve studies were included in this study. Among these, six papers reported lower blood loss in cemented TKA, while the other six papers found no significant difference in perioperative blood loss between the two groups. From the perspective of PBM, seven studies applied PBM protocols including systematic and topical tranexamic acid, autogenous transfusion, strict transfusion threshold and drain clamping, while the remaining five studies did not. If PBM protocols were implemented, no significant difference in blood loss was observed based on the implant fixation method. In the context of recent studies implementing PBM protocols, the choice of implant fixation method appears to have no relevant impact on post-TKA blood loss. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the reporting of outcomes and PBM protocols exhibit considerable variation and heterogeneity.","Kim Yong Deok, Cho Nicole, Sohn Sueen, Park Seokjae, You Hwang Yong, Koh In Jun",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Bone Cements, Postoperative Hemorrhage, Blood Transfusion",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39666005/,"Joint Replacement Center, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, 03312, Republic of Korea.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.; Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, 123 Metro Blvd, Nutley, NJ, 07100, USA.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital, Seoul, 01757, Republic of Korea.; Joint Replacement Center, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, 03312, Republic of Korea. esmh.jrcenter@gmail.com.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea. esmh.jrcenter@gmail.com.; Joint Replacement Center, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, College of Medicine, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, 1021, Tongil-ro, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul, 03312, Republic of Korea. esmh.jrcenter@gmail.com."
39659304,Does Tourniquet Use Impact Early Patient Outcomes in Total Knee Arthroplasty?,"Introduction Tourniquets are commonly used when performing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to reduce intra-operative blood loss, improve surgical field visibility, and potentially improve cement penetration during prosthesis implantation. However, they may be associated with increased thigh pain, postoperative opiate use, and longer lengths of hospital stay. Methods Retrospectively collected data was obtained from our institution's electronic patient records and database. We compared data between those patients receiving a TKA with or without tourniquet use. Our primary outcome measure was cement penetration on immediate postoperative X-rays. Secondary outcome measures included the need for opiate analgesia, blood loss, need for transfusion, and length of hospital stay. Results There were 285 patients in this study, with 170 patients undergoing TKA with a tourniquet and 115 patients without a tourniquet. There was a significantly better median total cement penetration as measured on combined anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs in the tourniquet group (39.14 vs 33.3mm, U=6991, z=-4.08, p<0.01). There was a statistically lower drop in hemoglobin levels when tourniquets were used (-13.4 (SD=8.6) vs -15.5 (SD=8.8), p=0.03). However, there were no cases in our series where patients required a transfusion. There was no significant difference in opiate analgesia requirements between tourniquet and non-tourniquet groups following surgery, 115 (68%) vs 69 (60%); X<sup>2 </sup>(1,285)=1.75, p=0.19. The median length of stay following surgery was slightly longer in the tourniquet group (2.5 vs 2.8 days); however, the Mann-Whitney U test indicated that this difference was not significant (U=9076, z=-0.70, p=0.31). Conclusion The use of a tourniquet was associated with significantly improved bone cement penetration as measured on postoperative AP and lateral radiographs. However, the clinical relevance of this in terms of implant survival remains controversial. Tourniquet use was also significantly associated with lower blood loss, but this did not translate into a lower need for transfusions. The use of a tourniquet was not associated with increased analgesia requirements following surgery or significantly longer lengths of stay.","Elbeshbeshy Mohamed, Azhar Muhammad Saad, Luqman Muhammad, Sabahuddin Ahmad, Bashir Oladimeji, Saber Ahmed Y, Parker James, Riaz Osman, McWilliams Timothy G, Aqil Adeel",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39659304/,"Trauma and Orthopaedics, Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust, Huddersfield, GBR."
39615061,Inferior short-term survivorship and patient outcomes for cementless compared to hybrid fixation with a cemented femoral implant in a novel blade-anchored medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty design: An analysis of 132 cases.,"For younger, more active patients, a cementless unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) might be more advantageous than cemented fixation. Therefore, this study aimed to compare implant survivorship and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) between cementless and hybrid fixation (cemented femur and cementless tibial fixation) in a novel tibial blade-anchored, medial UKA design. Two surgeon's registries were reviewed for patients who underwent primary cementless or hybrid medial UKA for medial osteoarthritis between 2019 and 2022. Patients were included if implant survivorship and one-year postoperative PROMs (UCLA-activity score, Oxford Knee Score (OKS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS-JR), pain (VAS) and satisfaction) were registered. Variables were compared using independent two-sample t-tests or the Chi-square test. Survival rates were determined using the Kaplan-Meier models and compared using the Log-rank test. A total of 132 knees were included (cementless 58.3%; cemented 41.7%; mean follow-up 3.1 ± 0.6 years). Three-year all-cause revision survival rate was significantly superior for the hybrid fixation (hybrid: 100%; cementless 88.5%[84.7%-92.3%], p = 0.026). However, the difference in three-year conversion rate to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) did not reach statistical significance. The one-year postoperative OKS (hybrid: 42.9 ± 4.8; cementless: 39.8 ± 6.4, p = 0.003) and KOOS-JR (hybrid:81.5 ± 13.7; cementless: 74.4 ± 12.1, p = 0.002) were significantly superior for the hybrid fixation. Three-year conversion rate to TKA and two-year postoperative PROMs did not significantly differ. The cementless medial UKA demonstrated a significantly inferior short-term all-cause survival rate and inferior postoperative one-year OKS and KOOS-JR compared to the hybrid medial UKA design with a cemented femoral component.","Vossen Roderick J M, Ruderman Lindsey V, Spaan Jonathan, Bayoumi Tarik, Su Edwin, Pearle Andrew D",The Knee,"Humans, Female, Male, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Aged, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Prosthesis Design, Middle Aged, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Prosthesis Failure, Bone Cements, Reoperation, Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39615061/,"Hospital for Special Surgery, Department of Computer Assisted Surgery and Sports Medicine, 535 East 70th Street, New York, NY 10021, United States; Amsterdam UMC Location University of Amsterdam, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

39606132,Early Outcome of a Contemporary Unicondylar Knee System.,"In 2019, a new fixed-bearing implant for unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) was introduced that incorporated a round-on-flat design featuring an Oxinium femoral component coupled with a highly crosslinked polyethylene bearing surface. Compared to prior implants, the design featured smaller size increments coupled with medial and lateral-specific tibial baseplates. The objective of this study is to describe our institution's early experience with this UKA implant system by evaluating survivorship, reasons for revision, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The 944 UKAs that comprise the study population, including 814 medial and 130 lateral joint replacements, were performed by six surgeons from September 2019 through the end of December 2023. All UKA components were cemented, the mean age at surgery was 67.1±10.0 years, 57% (537/944) of the UKAs were performed among women, and the mean body mass index was 30.3±6.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Outcome measures included Kaplan-Meier survivorship using reoperation for any reason as an endpoint, reasons for reoperation, range of motion, and PROMs that were collected preoperatively and postoperatively at 4 weeks, 4 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Using reoperation for any reason as an endpoint, 1-year survivorship was 99.3% (95% CI, 98.7 to 99.9%) and 2-year survivorship was 98.2% (95% CI, 96.9 to 99.5%). There were nine reoperations among the 944 UKAs, including three for infection, two for tibial loosening, one for femoral loosening, one for progression of arthritis, one for patellar instability, and one for recurrent hemarthrosis. The mean time to reoperation was 0.82±0.68 years and all were performed among medial UKAs. Range of motion increased from 117±8 degrees preoperatively to 122±6 degrees at 1-year follow-up. PROMs, including the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS JR) and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health Physical score, demonstrated progressive increases from the preoperative assessment through 2-year follow-up. For UKAs with preoperative and 2-year KOOS JR scores, the mean change was 31±17. As new implants and technologies are introduced, documenting the early outcome from high volume centers can offer valuable insights to validate the effectiveness of implant systems before they are adopted by the broader orthopedic community. This study demonstrates encouraging early outcome data associated with a contemporary UKA system based on survivorship and PROMs. At this early stage, there are no implant-related concerns but obtaining additional follow-up will be important to quantify how revisions and PROMs evolve over time.","Fricka Kevin B, Strait Alexander V, Ho Henry, Hopper Robert H, McAsey Craig J",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39606132/,"Orthopaedics, Anderson Orthopaedic Clinic, Arlington, USA.; Adult Hip and Knee Replacement, Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute, Alexandria, USA."
39591899,SPECT-CT may aid in determining which side of a revision stemmed implant problematic total knee replacement is loose when planning revision surgery.,"To evaluate SPECT-CT in the diagnosis of single component aseptic loosening in patients with a problematic cemented stemmed TKR (Total Knee Replacement). SPECT-CT was performed where aseptic loosening was suspected but was not clear on plain radiography. Demographics, suspected diagnosis and intention to revise were collected prospectively before and after SPECT-CT. 30 patients were investigated. 43% (95% CI: 0.5-0.9) had clear evidence of loosening on SPECT-CT. In 23% (95% CI: 0.1-0.4) intention to perform revision surgery following SPECT-CT changed (7/30) (p = 0.0004, standard error = 42.1, z = 3.5). Intentions to perform revision surgery according to the radiologist's overall summary were: Normal SPECT-CT - 0% (95% CI: 0.0-0.8) intention to revise (0/2). Possibly abnormal SPECT-CT - 13% (95% CI: 0.0-0.4) intention to revise (2/15). Definitely abnormal SPECT-CT - 77% (95% CI: 0.5-0.9) intention to revise (10/13). We report that SPECT-CT had a test sensitivity of 90.9% (95% CI: 0.6-1.0), a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 0.9-1.0), a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 97.7%. In 70% (95% CI: 0.3-0.9) of cases where revision surgery was performed for aseptic loosening SPECT-CT provided information that guided pre-operative planning with regards single component or both component revision surgery (7/10). When positive SPECT-CT was useful in determining single component revision. A normal SPECT-CT may have a negative predictive value; however, overall half of our series had a possibly abnormal or equivocal investigation.","Hill Daniel, Rogers Patrick, Phillips Jonathan, Waterson Ben, Toms Andrew D",The Knee,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Reoperation, Male, Female, Aged, Prosthesis Failure, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Aged, 80 and over, Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39591899/,"Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit, Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic Unit, Royal Devon University Healthcare Foundation Trust, Barrack Road, Exeter EX2 5DW, United Kingdom.

39589098,High-concentration continuous local antibacterial perfusion therapy: safety and potential efficacy for acute and chronic periprosthetic knee joint infection.,"Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are among the most challenging pathologies to manage. Recently, continuous local antibiotic perfusion (CLAP) therapy has been introduced for treating musculoskeletal infections in orthopedics. This study aimed to determine the outcomes and risks of CLAP therapy combined with conventional treatment for PJIs after TKA. We retrospectively evaluated 14 patients with PJIs. For acute PJIs, CLAP therapy was performed alongside debridement, intravenous antibiotics, and implant retention. For chronic PJIs, a two-stage revision with CLAP therapy and intravenous antibiotics was performed. Implants were replaced with a cement mold incorporating CLAP therapy, followed by revision surgery after 3 months. For all patients, 120 mg/day of gentamicin (GM) was locally administered into the knee joint for 2 weeks as part of CLAP therapy, in combination with perioperative intravenous antibiotics. Five patients developed acute PJIs, and nine developed chronic PJIs after TKA. The mean follow-up period was 18.4 (15.2-21.1) months. All five patients with PJIs treated with one-stage surgery (debridement and insert exchange only) successfully preserved their implants. Among the nine patients with chronic PJIs, seven underwent CLAP therapy combined with two-stage revision surgery, resulting in successful treatment without relapse, whereas the remaining two patients were initially treated with one-stage surgery and CLAP therapy but failed to retain their implants, and subsequently required additional two-stage revision surgery, which ultimately succeeded. No adverse effects from GM were reported. Our results suggest that CLAP therapy is safe and may be effective for treating acute and most chronic PJIs after TKA.","Suzuki Yuki, Iwasaki Koji, Joutoku Zenta, Onodera Tomohiro, Matsuoka Masatake, Hishimura Ryosuke, Hamasaki Masanari, Kondo Eiji, Iwasaki Norimasa",SICOT-J,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39589098/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 jo, Nishi 7 chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, 060-8638, Japan.; Department of Functional Reconstruction for the Knee Joint, Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 jo, Nishi 7 chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, 060-8638, Japan.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Obihiro Kosei Hospital, Nishi 14 jo, Minami 10 chome 1, Obihiro, Hokkaido, 080-0024, Japan.; Centre for Sports Medicine, Hokkaido University Hospital, Kita 14 jo Nishi 5 chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, 060-8648, Japan."
39586406,Maintenance of Coronal Alignment and Joint Line Obliquity Has No Effect on Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty: Clinical Results at Five Years Follow-Up.,"The applicability of the coronal plane alignment of the knee (CPAK) classification for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is not yet clear. The current study aimed to address the following questions: 1) what is the distribution of the CPAK classification among patients who underwent medial UKA? and 2) what would be the clinical outcomes for patients whose coronal alignment and joint line obliquity have either changed or been maintained postoperatively? This retrospective study involved 325 patients treated with fixed-bearing medial UKA between 2017 and 2019 following a kinematic alignment strategy and using cemented resurfacing implants. Long-leg standing radiographs were utilized for all preoperative and postoperative measurements. There were two independent observers who measured the alignment parameters. The patient's CPAK classification diagram was subsequently created. At the last follow-up, patients' outcomes were assessed using the clinical scores. The CPAK type 1 was the most prevalent type among 150 (46.1%) patients. Postoperatively, the most common CPAK type was type 2. In comparison to the preoperative distribution, there was a decrease in the prevalence of Types 1 and 4 in the postoperative distribution, whereas an increase in the distribution of all other types was noted. A total of 203 patients (62.4%) experienced CPAK classification change postoperatively, of which 122 patients (37.5%) maintained their original preoperative CPAK classification (P = 0.003). At a mean follow-up of 66.1 months (range, 54 to 75), implant survival (P = 0.9) and all clinical scores were similar between the CPAK Maintained and Changed groups (P > 0.05 for all). The use of UKA may alter the preoperative CPAK distribution in more than half of the patients. Following UKA, a maintained coronal alignment and joint line obliquity do not have an impact on either patient-reported outcomes or implant survival.

39571683,When disaster strikes: Conversion of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty to total knee arthroplasty<sup>☆</sup>.,"To investigate the causes of failure in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), types of implants used in the revision, evaluate the need to use tibial stems, metal block augmentations, and bone grafts during conversion to total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In a 10-year retrospective analysis, focussing on cases of UKA failure, our study aimed to categorise early and late failures, determine the primary failure modes and assess the utilisation of bone augmentations and grafts during conversion to TKA. We evaluated patient data, diagnoses, procedure intervals, and follow-up periods to provide a comprehensive understanding of the conversion process. During the past decade, 301 UKA procedures were performed, with 36 knees (11.96%) requiring conversion to TKA. Patient ages averaged 64.3 years, with varied diagnoses, including osteoarthritis and avascular necrosis. The most common failure mode was component loosening or sinking (52.78%), followed by progression of arthritis (25%). Of the 31 cases with mobile-bearing UKA, 9 (29.03%) developed instability and displacement of the polyethylene. Of the 36 cases converted from UKA to TKA, in 31 (86.11%) a revision tibial component with a tibial stem was used. Metal block augmentation was performed in 19 knees (52,78%). All revised UKAs were converted to cemented TKA, with a focus on addressing tibial side issues, which constituted 72.22% of the revisions. This study highlights the challenges associated with UKA failure, particularly early failures linked to displaced bearings. Converting from UKA to TKA presents technical hurdles, including rod alignment and utilisation. Management of proximal tibial defects with metal block augmentation proving to be a viable approach. The use of modular metal augmentation simplifies the reconstruction process. Although the study has limitations, it contributes valuable information about the complexities of knee arthroplasty conversion.

39569799,Robotic Assistance Is Not Associated With Decreased Early Revisions in Cementless TKA: An Analysis of the American Joint Replacement Registry.,"Previously, we conducted a retrospective study of American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) data that examined the 2-year odds of revision between robotic-assisted and nonrobotic-assisted TKA, and we found no benefit to robotic assistance. However, proponents of robotic assistance have suggested that robot platforms confer more accurate bone cuts and precise implant sizing that might promote osteointegration of cementless implants by limiting micromotion at the bone-implant interface that could lead to aseptic loosening. Therefore, it seems important specifically to evaluate the odds of revision among patients with cementless implants only within our previous study population. (1) After controlling for potentially confounding variables, such as surgeon, institution, and patient comorbidity profile, was robotic assistance associated with a decreased odds of 2-year revision of cementless TKA for any reason compared with cementless TKAs performed without robotic assistance? (2) After again controlling for potentially confounding variables, was robotic assistance associated with a decreased odds of 2-year revision of cementless TKA for particular revision indications (such as aseptic loosening, infection, instability, or pain) compared with the cementless TKAs performed without robotic assistance? Using the AJRR, a retrospective cohort of patients ≥ 65 years of age with osteoarthritis who underwent primary TKA with cementless femur and tibial components from January 2017 through March 2020 was identified. Procedures performed with hybrid fixation (cement only on the tibia but not on the femur, or vice versa) were excluded. The AJRR was selected because it is the largest arthroplasty registry in the world by annual procedure volume, and it contains a data linkage with inpatient and outpatient Medicare claims data to ensure near-complete 2-year follow-up. A total of 9220 patients were identified, and robotic assistance was used in 45% (4130) of procedures. Patient age did not differ between groups (72 ± 5 years versus 72 ± 5 years; p = 0.29). However, the robotic-assisted cohort had a slightly higher proportion of female patients (56% [2332 of 4130] versus 53% [2693 of 5090]; p = 0.002) and higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) (2.9 ± 0.9 versus 2.8 ± 0.9; p = 0.003). Therefore, a mixed-effects model was used to analyze the ORs for all-cause linked revision with robotic assistance and was adjusted for age, gender, CCI, surgeon, and institution. Subanalyses were performed on indications for revision. A power analysis demonstrated the ability to measure a difference as small as one-half SD between risk of revision within each cohort (specifically, moderate effect sizes based on Cohen d). After controlling for potentially confounding variables, such as surgeon, location of surgery, and patient comorbidity profile, we found no difference regarding odds of all-cause revision between robotic-assisted and nonrobotic-assisted cementless TKA (OR of robotic-assisted versus nonrobotic-assisted cementless TKA 0.8 [95% CI 0.5 to 1.3]; p = 0.41). There were no differences in reasons for revision between robotic-assisted and nonrobotic-assisted cementless TKA, such as mechanical loosening (OR 3.2 [95% CI 0.8 to 12]; p = 0.09) and infection (OR 1.5 [95% CI 0.8 to 2.6]; p = 0.19). We found no evidence that robotic assistance improves the odds of cementless implant survival free from revision at 2 years. Importantly, the differences in odds of revision beyond 2 years as a function of robotic assistance in cementless TKA remains unknown and warrants further population-level investigation, but until or unless robotic assistance proves its value in well-designed studies in terms of endpoints that patients can perceive (such as pain, function, or survivorship), we recommend against widespread adoption until further evidence becomes available. Additionally, we encourage surgeons and healthcare facilities using robotic assistance in cementless TKAs to study its impact on patient outcomes, if any.

39567387,Prevalence and clinical impact of radiographic sclerotic lines adjacent to cementless tibial stems in revision total knee arthroplasty: a long-term follow-up study.,"Intramedullary stem extensions are typically added to the femoral and tibial components during revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to augment fixation of the components and improve survivorship. A commonly used option includes hybrid fixation with cement at the interface between the component and the host bone combined with cementless diaphyseal fitting stems. Radiographic sclerotic lines may appear with these constructs over time, and it is unclear if this finding has implications relative to implant survivorship. The purpose of this study was to quantify the prevalence of sclerotic lines at the bone-implant interface and assess the impact of progressive sclerotic lines on revision for aseptic loosening. A retrospective chart review of a consecutive series of patients who underwent revision TKA at a single tertiary care institution between January 2001 and December 2009 was performed. Data were collected regarding patient demographics, stem size, types of implants, and complications. Radiological reports and radiographs were evaluated for sclerotic lines, propagation, and their location around the tibial stem. Aseptic loosening rates were compared between patients with and without sclerotic lines. One hundred and fifty-three patients with at least 15 years of follow-up were identified. The mean follow-up was 16.5 ± 4.12 years (range 15-23). Overall, 19 patients required re-revision surgery. Survivorship free of failure due to aseptic loosening was 94.8% (95% CI 76.4-98) at 15 years, with three patients requiring re-revision surgery for aseptic loosening. Twelve (7.8%) patients were found to have sclerotic lines surrounding the tibial stem, all under 2 mm in width. Two (1%) patients with sclerotic lines required re-revision surgery, one patient due to infection and one due to aseptic loosening. There was no significant difference in rates of aseptic loosening in patients with or without sclerotic lines. Radiographic sclerotic lines around revision TKA stems-measuring less than 2mm wide, nonprogressive, and located at the lateral-distal aspect of the stem-were identified in fewer than 8% of cases and did not correlate with re-revision surgery.","Greenberg Arieh, Cohen Daniel, Ekhtiari Seper, Abughaduma Nada Read, Hakim Raja, Barimani Bardia, Wolfstadt Jesse, Backstein David",European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Female, Male, Reoperation, Aged, Retrospective Studies, Prosthesis Failure, Follow-Up Studies, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Tibia, Radiography, Sclerosis, Prevalence, Adult, Aged, 80 and over, Bone-Implant Interface",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39567387/,"Granovsky Gluskin Orthopedic Division.

The literature supports patella resurfacing in primary posterior-stabilized compared to cruciate-retaining (CR) TKA due to higher revision rates with nonresurfaced patella. However, it is unclear if UC liners alter patella-related revisions. The aim of the study was to compare patella revision rates and survivorship of UC versus CR liners in primary TKA without patella resurfacing using two common prostheses in patients who had osteoarthritis. This was a retrospective cohort analysis of data from the Australian Orthopedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry. Patients who underwent primary TKA utilizing one of two common knee systems with cemented tibial fixation for osteoarthritis and did not have their patella resurfaced between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2022, were included for analysis. A total of 42,105 primary TKA procedures were included (UC, n = 18,989 and CR, n = 23,116). The risk of patella-related revision and survivorship for primary TKA procedures with UC compared to CR liners were analyzed. The cumulative revision at 14 years was 5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7 to 6.9) and 5.4% (95% CI 4.8 to 6.1) for the CR and UC group, respectively, with no difference between groups (entire period: HR [hazard ratio] = 1.07 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.20), P = 0.256). When revision TKA for patella-related diagnoses was analyzed, there was no difference between the CR and UC groups (entire period: HR = 1.10 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.38), P = 0.406). The prosthesis-specific analyses did not produce any differences between the groups for all-cause or patella-related revisions. The use of UC compared to CR liners in primary TKA without patella resurfacing was not associated with an increased rate of all-cause or patella-related revisions. Surgeons should make clinical decisions on the need for patella resurfacing based on other patient, surgical, and implant factors.","Onggo James R, Holder Carl, McAuliffe Michael J, Babazadeh Sina",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Patella, Male, Female, Reoperation, Aged, Retrospective Studies, Registries, Knee Prosthesis, Australia, Middle Aged, Polyethylene, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Prosthesis Design, Prosthesis Failure, Aged, 80 and over",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39551405/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Box Hill Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Department of Orthopaedics, Wangaratta Hospital, Wangaratta, Victoria, Australia.; Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia; South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.; Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Box Hill Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Department of Orthopaedics, St Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia."
39542039,Leaving the Patella Unresurfaced Does Not Increase the Risk of Short-Term Revision Following Total Knee Arthroplasty: An Analysis from the American Joint Replacement Registry.,"The benefit of patellar resurfacing in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains uncertain, with conflicting evidence regarding associated revision rates and clinical outcomes. Although initial studies have reported higher revision rates associated with unresurfaced patellae, recent evidence questions the necessity of routine patellar resurfacing. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of revision following TKA performed with and without patellar resurfacing using data from the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR).The AJRR was queried for all patients aged 65 years and older undergoing elective TKA between January 2012 and March 2020 with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Cases were linked using supplemental Centers for Medicare and Medicaid data. Cases with hybrid fixation, highly constrained implants, and revision components were excluded. Patients were categorized into two groups: those with a resurfaced patella and those without. Cumulative incidence function (CIF) curves and cause-specific Cox models were utilized to assess all-cause revision risk, adjusting for sex, age, femoral design (cruciate retaining vs. posterior stabilized), fixation type (cemented vs. cementless), and Charlson Comorbidity Index.Of the 390,304 TKAs with minimum 2-year follow-up in our cohort, 22,829 had no patellar resurfacing performed. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) revealed no significant difference in all-cause revision (HR = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81-1.13, <i>p</i> = 0.656), revision for mechanical loosening (HR = 1.61 [0.88, 2.93], <i>p</i> = 0.122), or revision for infection (HR = 1.02 [0.79, 1.33], <i>p</i> = 0.860) associated with patellar resurfacing status.Our study found that patients with an unresurfaced patella do not face an increased short-term revision risk following TKA.

39528168,Bisphosphonate Use in Patients Who Have Osteoporosis Does Not Increase the Risk of Periprosthetic Fracture Following Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative bisphosphonate use in patients who have osteoporosis on the risk of complications following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). An administrative claims database was queried for patients who have osteoporosis undergoing primary TKA between 2010 and 2019 with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Bisphosphonate-naive patients and bisphosphonate users, defined as patients who had a continuous prescription for bisphosphonates for a minimum of 6 months preoperatively, were matched 1:1 based on age, sex, and comorbidity burden. Patients undergoing nonelective TKA on chronic glucocorticoid therapy or receiving any other pharmacologic treatment for osteoporosis were excluded. The final cohort included 21,058 matched pairs of patients. The incidence of postoperative complications was identified via International Classification of Disease coding and compared between matched groups. A subgroup analysis was performed to examine outcomes among patients who underwent cemented and cementless TKA. There was no difference in the incidence of periprosthetic fracture on univariate (0.7 versus 0.8%, P = 0.068) or multivariate testing (OR [odds ratio]: 1.24, 95% confidence interval [0.99 to 1.56]; P = 0.060). Bisphosphonate users were statistically less likely to undergo all-cause revision TKA at 2 years (OR: 0.84 [0.72 to 0.97]; P = 0.021). Patients who had osteoporosis were found to have an increased risk of periprosthetic fracture when TKA was performed with cementless implants (1.6 versus 0.4%; P = 0.033). However, when treated with bisphosphonates, patients who have osteoporosis demonstrated equivalent fracture rates regardless of implant type (1.3 versus 1.0%; P = 1.000). While bisphosphonate use in patients who have osteoporosis did not decrease the risk of periprosthetic fracture, it did significantly lower the incidence of all-cause revision at 2 years, although the difference identified was small. Consideration should be given to performing cemented TKA in patients who have untreated osteoporosis, given the higher rate of periprosthetic fracture when cementless implants were utilized.","Forlenza Enrico M, Serino Joseph, Acuña Alexander J, Terhune E Bailey, Behery Omar A, Della Valle Craig J",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Female, Male, Aged, Diphosphonates, Periprosthetic Fractures, Osteoporosis, Middle Aged, Bone Density Conservation Agents, Retrospective Studies, Incidence, Aged, 80 and over, Postoperative Complications, Risk Factors, Databases, Factual",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39528168/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois."

However, the long-term risks and benefits of HXLPE in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain unknown. This randomized clinical trial evaluated implant survivorship, complications, radiographic results, and clinical outcomes of HXLPE and conventional ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) inserts in primary TKAs. We enrolled 518 patients (518 knees) who underwent primary TKA in 3 centers within 1 tertiary referral network. The mean age was 67 years, the mean body mass index was 32 kg/m 2 , and 58% of the patients were women. All of the patients underwent primary TKA with a cemented posterior-stabilized tibial insert and patellar resurfacing. Randomization proceeded via stratified dynamic allocation. The patients were blinded to their study group allocation: those in the control group (254 knees) underwent TKA with an UHMWPE insert (N2Vac; Stryker); those in the treatment group (264 knees) received an HXLPE insert (X3; Stryker). Kaplan-Meier survivorship, radiographic results, and clinical outcomes were assessed. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. The mean follow-up was 11 years. The 10-year overall survivorship free from any revision and from any reoperation was 96% and 94%, respectively. There were no differences in the risk of revision or reoperation between the groups (p > 0.05). There were a total of 19 revisions. Revision indications included periprosthetic joint infection (14 knees), instability (4 knees), and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for a patellar fracture due to osteolysis around a UHMWPE insert (1 knee). There were no revisions due to polyethylene wear, osteolysis, or fracture of the post in the HXLPE group. The radiographic results and clinical outcomes were otherwise similar. Notably, no wear-related failures were identified in the HXLPE group, but there was 1 case of osteolysis in the UHMWPE group. Therapeutic Level I .

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of different application times of 2 different cements on mechanical parameters, cement interdigitation, and cement distribution. P.F.C. Sigma tibial trays were cemented with high-viscous Palacos R and medium- to low-viscous Simplex P in an open-cell model. The application was performed at different times within the manufacturer's specifications. Cement interdigitation and micromotion were measured with computed tomography scan using a novel method. Significant differences of insertion forces were found at all times of cement application. Cement penetration decreased with increasing pressure and viscosity. No significant differences were shown for micromotion between Palacos R and Simplex P except for an increase for Simplex P from 3 to 7 minutes at the bone-cement interface. Simplex P appeared to trap air at the implant-cement interface at 3 minutes and increased at 7 minutes. Cement distribution and intrusion of Palacos R and Simplex P decreased with time. Simplex P trapped air at the implant-cement interface, decreasing the amount of contact at the implant-cement interface, which is worrisome for long-term implant fixation. Given the significant changes in cement properties after mixing, it is necessary for surgeons to understand the viscosity and timing of cement application to achieve optimal cement penetration and surface contact area to potentially decrease implant loosening. High-viscous Palacos R should be applicated immediately with doughing time and medium-viscous Simplex P for about 4 minutes considering a threshold of minimum pressure.","Fölsch Christian, Schirmer Julia, Glameanu Cosmin, Ishaque Bernd, Fonseca Ulloa Carlos Alfonso, Harz Torben, Rickert Markus, Martin John Ryan, Scherberich Jan, Steinbart Jessica, Krombach Gabriele, Paul Christian, Kühn Klaus-Dieter, Jahnke Alexander",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39492999/,"Department of Orthopaedics and Orthopaedic Surgery, University Hospital Gießen and Marburg (UKGM), Justus-Liebig-University, Gießen, Germany.; Laboratory of Biomechanics, Justus-Liebig-University Gießen, Gießen, Germany.; Adult Reconstruction, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Laboratory for Experimental Radiology, Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Justus-Liebig-University, Gießen, Germany.; Institute of Physical Chemistry, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen, Giessen, Germany.; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma, Medical University Graz, Graz, Austria."
39481434,Radiolucent lines and revision risk in total knee arthroplasty using the conventional versus the Attune S+ tibial baseplate.,"This multicentre retrospective observational study's aims were to investigate whether there are differences in the occurrence of radiolucent lines (RLLs) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between the conventional Attune baseplate and its successor, the novel Attune S+, independent from other potentially influencing factors; and whether tibial baseplate design and presence of RLLs are associated with differing risk of revision. A total of 780 patients (39% male; median age 70.7 years (IQR 62.0 to 77.2)) underwent cemented TKA using the Attune Knee System) at five centres, and with the latest radiograph available for the evaluation of RLL at between six and 36 months from surgery. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were performed to assess associations between patient and implant-associated factors on the presence of tibial and femoral RLLs. Differences in revision risk depending on RLLs and tibial baseplate design were investigated with the log-rank test. The conventional and novel Attune baseplates were used in 349 (45%) and 431 (55%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 14 months (IQR 11 to 25), RLLs were present in 29% (n = 228/777) and 15% (n = 116/776) of the tibial and femoral components, respectively, and were more common in the conventional compared to the novel baseplate. The novel baseplate was independently associated with a lower incidence of tibial and femoral RLLs (both regardless of age, sex, BMI, and time to radiograph). One- and three-year revision risk was 1% (95% CI 0.4% to 1.9%)and 6% (95% CI 2.6% to 13.2%), respectively. There was no difference between baseplate design and the presence of RLLs on the the risk of revision at short-term follow-up. The overall incidence of RLLs, as well as the incidence of tibial and femoral RLLs, was lower with the novel compared to the conventional tibial Attune baseplate design, but higher than in the predecessor design and other commonly used TKA systems.","Smolle Maria A, Keintzel Maximilian, Staats Kevin, Böhler Christoph, Windhager Reinhard, Koutp Amir, Leithner Andreas, Donner Stefanie, Reiner Tobias, Renkawitz Tobias, Sava Manuel-Paul, Hirschmann Michael T, Sadoghi Patrick",The bone & joint journal,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Female, Aged, Reoperation, Retrospective Studies, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Prosthesis Design, Prosthesis Failure, Tibia, Risk Factors, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Radiography",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39481434/,"Department of Orthopedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.; Department of Orthopedics and Trauma-Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Charite - Center for Musculosceletal Surgery, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Orthopaedics, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, Kantonsspital Baselland, Bruderholz, Switzerland."
39427817,Cemented versus cementless unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) offers a more conservative treatment than total knee arthroplasty when osteoarthritis affects only one tibiofemoral knee compartment. Cemented UKA has become the gold standard due to its good functional outcomes and low revision rates. The most common reasons for revision with cemented UKA include aseptic loss, unexplained pain, and radiolucent lines. Cementless UKA, which adds a porous coating of titanium and hydroxyapatite as well as an additional peg on the femoral component, has been shown to reduce the prevalence of radiolucencies compared to cemented UKAs. National registry data have demonstrated comparable functional outcomes and improved revision rates with cementless UKA. This review aims to summarize various advancements in unicompartmental prostheses, and to highlight how the conceptual advantages of the cementless model lead to superior implant survivorship and functional outcomes.","Iñiguez C Magaly, Anastasiadis Zoy, Nazer María Ignacia, Sandoval Rodrigo",Journal of ISAKOS : joint disorders & orthopaedic sports medicine,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Prosthesis Design, Reoperation, Bone Cements, Treatment Outcome, Prosthesis Failure, Titanium, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39427817/,"Clínica Meds, Avenida José Alcalde Délano 10581, Lo Barnechea, Santiago, Chile; Hospital Sótero del Río, Avenida Concha y Toro 3459, Puente Alto, Chile.

39426678,Patient satisfaction following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: Current concepts.,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has gained progressive popularity in recent decades, currently comprising approximately 10% of knee arthroplasties in the United States. Nonetheless, UKA has not yet solidified its position as the superior treatment for isolated compartment osteoarthritis, as initially reported implant survivorship was subpar, leading to hesitation in its utilization and stricter patient indications compared to total knee arthroplasty. Patient satisfaction following knee arthroplasty has emerged as a critical metric to gauge patient acceptance and contentment with surgical interventions. Currently, a variety of UKA types exist, differing in bearing design, fixation techniques such as cementless or cemented fixation, and robotic-assisted systems, each with its own merits and drawbacks. Multiple studies have demonstrated the contributions of these innovations to improve clinical outcomes and implant survivorship. However, the abundance of studies has made it challenging to establish a clear overview. This paper provides an overview of the current concepts of UKA, evaluating various aspects of UKA referencing to patient satisfaction and providing a recap of its historical development. Available research demonstrated no significantly universal superior variant of UKA.","Vossen Roderick J M, Ten Noever de Brauw Gaby V, Bayoumi Tarik, Zuiderbaan Hendrik A, Pearle Andrew D",Journal of ISAKOS : joint disorders & orthopaedic sports medicine,"Humans, Patient Satisfaction, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Design, Treatment Outcome, Robotic Surgical Procedures",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39426678/,"Hospital for Special Surgery, Department of Sports Medicine and Computer Assisted Surgery, 535 East 70th Street, New York, NY 10021, USA; Amsterdam UMC Location University of Amsterdam, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

39419420,Osteoporosis May Not Be an Absolute Contraindication for Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has received growing interest, particularly in younger populations, due to potential long-term survivability and improved bone preservation. Poor bone stock, as seen in osteoporosis, is considered a contraindication for this technique. This study evaluated whether osteoporotic patients < 75 years undergoing cementless TKA demonstrate similar: 1) implant-related complications, 2) medical complications, 3) readmission rates, and 4) 3-year implant survivability. A retrospective query of a national administrative claims database was performed between 2010 and 2022 for patients less than or equal to 75 years old who have osteoporosis and underwent primary TKA. Osteoporotic patients were divided into cementless and cemented cohorts, and propensity scores were matched based on age, sex, obesity, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Matching produced 7,923 patients (1,321 uncemented, 6,602 cemented). Multivariate logistic regressions evaluated the following outcomes: 90-day and 2-year implant-related complications, 90-day postoperative medical complications, and 90-day readmissions. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to assess 3-year all-cause revision implant survivability. The significance threshold was set to P < 0.01 to minimize type 1 bias. There were no statistically significant differences in implant-related complications, medical complications, readmissions, and lengths of stay between cementless and cemented TKA groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated statistically similar 3-year survivability between cohorts (cemented: 97.6%, confidence interval 96.6 to 98.5; cementless: 97.2%, confidence interval 96.7 to 97.7; P = 0.472). Patients who have osteoporosis have equivalent medical and implant-related complications as well as 3-year implant survival following cementless TKA compared with a cemented technique. Our results support cementless TKA as a viable option for patients < 75 years, regardless of prior diagnosis of osteoporosis. Intraoperative decisions regarding bone quality are still necessary to discriminate between those who are candidates for cementless TKA with those who are not.

39404503,Accuracy and precision of Volumetric Matching Micromotion Analysis (V3MA) is similar to RSA for tibial component migration in TKA.,"Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) is the current gold standard to determine implant migration, but it requires bone markers and special equipment. Therefore, we developed VoluMetric Matching Micromotion Analysis (V3MA), a software program for Computed Tomography-based radiostereometric analysis (CT-RSA). This study aimed to determine the accuracy and precision of V3MA in vitro compared to RSA and provide a clinical proof of concept. The accuracy (RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)) and precision (SD (standard deviation)) of V3MA were compared to RSA. A tibial component was placed in 21 different positions within a cadaveric bone to assess accuracy. For precision, a total of 20 repeated zero-migration examinations from 4 cadaveric bones with cemented tibial components were performed. In 6 total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients 1 to 5 year migration was measured with V3MA and RSA. V3MA accuracy ranged between 0.02 and 0.09 mm for translations and was 0.01° for internal-external rotations. For RSA, the accuracy ranged between 0.03 and 0.09 mm for translations and was 0.09° for internal-external rotations. V3MA precision ranged between 0.01 and 0.06 mm for translations and 0.02 to 0.07° for rotations. RSA precision ranged between 0.00 and 0.06 mm for translations and 0.04 to 0.25° for rotations. V3MA was successful in 6 clinical cases and no systematic bias was present. In conclusion, the accuracy and precision of V3MA were similar to RSA. Therefore, V3MA is a promising alternative to RSA in migration measurements of tibial components in TKA.","de Laat Nienke N, Koster Lennard A, Stoel Berend C, Nelissen Rob G H H, Kaptein Bart L",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Radiostereometric Analysis, Tibia, Aged, Male, Female, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Middle Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Software",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39404503/,"Department of Orthopaedics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.; Department of Radiology, Division of Image Processing, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands."
39396419,Robotic assistance improves success of cementless component fixation in one total knee arthroplasty system.,"New cementless implant designs in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) have begun to shift the longstanding practice of cemented fixation. With aseptic loosening a leading cause for revision of cementless implants, initial osteointegration is critical for component survivorship. Robotic-assisted TKA (RA-TKA) has shown promising results in recent literature at improving component accuracy. The current study aims to evaluate if robotic assistance affects the success of cementless fixation in primary TKA. 445 cementless primary TKA components from one manufacturer implanted by five surgeons between June 2018 and October 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Those with minimum one-year follow-up were analyzed. Femoral and tibial components were reviewed separately and grouped based on whether manual or RA-TKA from the same manufacturer was performed. Fisher's exact test was used to analyze if aseptic loosening rates were different between the two techniques. 373 (82%) cementless components from a single knee system were included. 146 femoral and 103 tibial components were implanted using RA-TKA, while 63 femoral and 61 tibial components were implanted manually. At a mean follow-up of 18 months (range, 12 to 51 months), successful fixation was achieved in 96.2% of all components. No femoral components from either group were revised due to aseptic loosening. Four manually implanted vs. no robotically assisted tibial components were revised due to aseptic loosening (6.6% vs 0.0%; P = 0.038). The performance of modern cementless femoral components was excellent with or without robotic assistance, however RA-TKA improved the survivorship of the same system's cementless tibial component.

39369428,High accuracy of component positioning and restoration of lower limb alignment using robotic medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.,"Unicondylar arthroplasty was performed using robotic medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (R-mUKA) and gap-balancing instrumentation. Our hypothesis was that robotic unicondylar knee arthroplasty accurately restores component positioning and lower limb alignment when compared to preoperative planning with actual implantation throughout the range of knee motion due to proper knee balancing. Data were collected prospectively and were analysed for patients undergoing R-mUKA. A cemented UKA was implanted using the MAKO® robotic system. Lower limb alignment at 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90° of flexion was recorded of the native knee, with the trial components in place and finally after component implantation. A spacer according to the femorotibial gap was introduced and the alignment was measured. The position of the final component was planned based on three-dimensional computed tomography images before making the bone cuts. The positioning of the femoral and tibial components was analysed in all three planes. A total of 52 patients were included (mean age 66.3 ± 6.7 years; 34 males, 18 females). The difference in femoral component position after planning and final implantation was 0.04° ± 0.58° more valgus in the coronal plane (p = 0.326) and 0.6° ± 1.4° more flexion relative to the sagittal plane (p = 0.034). The tibial component was placed in the coronal plane in 0.3° ± 0.8° of more varus (p = 0.113) and in the sagittal plane in 0.6° ± 1.2° of more posterior tibial slope (p = 0.001). Lower limb alignment of the native knee in extension was 5.8° ± 2.6° of varus and changed to 3° ± 2.1° varus after UKA (p ≤ 0.01). R-mUKA helps to achieve the target of alignment and component position without any significant differences to the planning. Ligament balancing causes non-significant changes in component position. It allows optimal component position even for off-the-shelf implants respecting the patient's specific anatomy.

39340551,Evaluation of a radiological grading system for the early detection of total knee arthroplasties at risk for revision surgery.,"X-rays are regularly performed after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). While soft tissue management and ligament tension cannot be evaluated, important information, such as inadequate component positioning and loose cement location, as well as subsequent loosening, can be detected. The aim of this study was to correlate radiological findings, referring to the radiological grading system (previously published by the same study group, henceforth abbreviated as ""RGS""), with long-term outcomes and implant survival. A total of 266 patients who underwent titanium-coated TKA were included. In addition to implant survival, visual analogue scale score, Tegner activity score, knee society score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and short form-12 score as well as range of motion were evaluated. Clinical examination as well as anterior-posterior, lateral, full-length weight bearing, and patellar view radiographs were performed pre- and postoperatively, at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month postoperative follow-ups and at the final follow-up. The radiological grading system was evaluated and correlated with long-term outcome and survivorship. The revision-free survival rate was 88.4% at a median follow-up of 9.8 years (IQR: 9.3-10.3 years; range: 0.1-11.8 years). Revision surgery was required in 31 TKAs (11.7%). The multivariate Cox regression model showed a significant association between an RGS score ≥ 3 deviation points (DP) and an increased risk for revision (hazard ratio: 2.092; 95% CI: 1.020-4.290; p = 0.044). Moreover, the KSS for pain was significantly worse in patients with a RGS score ≥ 3 DP (median, 85 [74-92] vs. 90 [80-94]; p = 0.007). This is the first study indicating that deviation in component positioning, having an inadequate long leg axis, the presence of free cement or residual bony structures on postoperative X-rays significantly correlate with TKA outcome and implant survival. Therefore RGS can be of high predicable value for the survivorship of the prosthesis.

39307203,Early Aseptic Tibial Loosening Is a Concern With a Modern Two-Peg Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty Design.,"While early generations of cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) had inferior outcomes compared to cemented TKA, modern cementless designs have offered excellent clinical results. The purpose of this study was to compare patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and early aseptic revision rates of a specific cementless TKA design featuring a two-pegged tibia to that of its cemented counterpart. A retrospective case series of all cementless and cemented TKAs utilizing a single design performed at a single, high-volume academic center was performed. Institutional review board approval was obtained. All cases were performed between November 2018 and March 2022. A minimum one-year follow-up was required. Demographics, complications, and reoperation/revision data were collected. Oxford Knee Score and Forgotten Joint Score were collected at one-year follow-up. Radiographic review was performed for cementless TKAs that were revised or had PROMs < one SD (""poor performers"") or had PROMs > one SD (""high performers"") below or above the mean, respectively. There were 329 cementless and 349 cemented TKAs included. Mean follow-up was 1.9 and 2.6 years for cementless and cemented cohorts, respectively. There were no statistical PROM differences between the two cohorts. There was no statistical difference in aseptic revision rates between the cohorts (4.0% cementless versus 1.7% cemented, P = 0.078); however, there was a higher rate of tibial aseptic loosening in the cementless cohort (2.7% cementless versus 0% cemented, P = 0.002).

39295710,Total Knee Arthroplasty With Long-Stem Implant: A Case Report of a Patient With Extreme Varus Deformity.,"Constrained implants have become more common in difficult primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) cases in recent years because they may more effectively and conveniently handle the substantial instability that is evident in osteoarthritis of knees with severe varus deformity. However, the need for a constrained TKA in such conditions is controversial, as constraint implants come with a bargain of stability for longitivity. In this case report, we have successfully shown that even in cases of significant instability and bone loss, intraoperative conversion to a restricted device is rarely necessary. In our case report, a 83-year-old female had complaints of severe pain in bilateral knees, with the right knee more than the left knee, since 12 years with severe varus deformity in the right knee. Physical examination revealed swelling and medial joint line tenderness with restriction of range of motion in bilateral knees. Pre-anesthetic checkup of the patient was done and patient was given clearance for surgery under American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA)-2, total knee arthroplasty with a long stem was done, extreme varus deformity was corrected, osteophytes removed and tibial bone loss was repaired with bone cement. Post operatively patient showed significant improvement and McMaster University and Western Ontario Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Knee Society Scores (KSS) for pain, stiffness, and physical function during everyday activities were significantly improved compared to pre-operative assessment.","Patil Vishal S, Nair Vinod, Todkar Amogh, Shah Meet",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39295710/,"Orthopaedics, Dr. D.

39293088,Is 18 F-fluoride PET/CT an Accurate Tool to Diagnose Loosening After Total Joint Arthroplasty?,"Several studies using positron emission tomography (PET) show highly elevated periprosthetic bone uptake of fluorine-18 sodium fluoride ( 18 F-fluoride), suggestive of implant loosening after arthroplasty. Focus so far has been on qualitative but not on quantitative assessment. There is also a lack of intraoperative confirmation of preoperative 18 F-fluoride PET findings. Although the method seems to have acceptable accuracy and high sensitivity, an attempt to improve the specificity and an overall validation of the method appear warranted. (1) Is there a difference in 18 F-fluoride uptake around loose versus well-fixed THA and TKA components? (2) Can 18 F-fluoride uptake measures provide a threshold that differentiates loose from well-fixed implants undergoing revision for a variety of septic and aseptic indications? (3) In a population restricted to THA and TKA undergoing revision for aseptic indications, can measurement of 18 F-fluoride uptake still distinguish loose from well-fixed components? (4) What is the interrater reliability of measuring 18 F-fluoride uptake? This was a retrospective assessment of a diagnostic test, 18 F-fluoride PET/CT, which was performed prior to revision surgery. We included 63 patients with 31 THAs and 32 TKAs. Sixty-five percent of patients were female, and the mean age at 18 F-fluoride PET/CT was 66 years. The THA had different modes of fixation (cemented, cementless, and hybrid; 45%, 32%, and 23%, respectively), whereas all TKAs were cemented. Imaging was conducted using routine protocols 1 hour after tracer injection. The interobserver reproducibility was analyzed using Spearman rank correlations and Bland-Altman analyses. Two independent observers were trained separately by a nuclear physician to measure maximal periprosthetic standardized uptake values (SUV max ) for each arthroplasty component (n = 126). Findings at surgery (whether the components were well fixed or loose, as well as the presence or absence of infection) were used as a reference. Presence of periprosthetic joint infection was retrospectively determined based on the criteria suggested by the European Bone and Joint Infection Society (EBJIS): clinical features in combination with blood analysis, synovial fluid cytologic analysis, and microbiology test results. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to assess the area under the curve (AUC) for each investigated component separately, indicating suitable SUV max thresholds that differentiate loose from well-fixed components. After excluding patients with confirmed or suspected PJI per the EBJIS criteria (n = 12), the above analysis was repeated for the remaining patients with aseptic loosening (n = 51). We found higher 18 F-fluoride uptake around loose versus well-fixed components in all but femoral TKA components (median [range] SUV max for well-fixed versus loose THA cups 10 [7 to 30] versus 22 [6 to 64], difference of medians 12; p = 0.003; well-fixed versus loose TKA femoral components 14 [4 to 41] versus 19 [9 to 42], difference of medians 5; p = 0.38). We identified favorable ROC curves for all investigated components except femoral TKA components (THA cups AUC 0.81 [best threshold 13.9]; THA femoral stems AUC 0.9 [best threshold 17.3]; femoral TKA components AUC 0.6 [best threshold 14.3]; tibial TKA components AUC 0.83 [best threshold 15.8]). 18 F-fluoride was even more accurate at diagnosing loosening when we limited the population to those patients believed not to have prosthetic joint infection (THA cups AUC 0.87 [best threshold 14.2]; THA femoral stems AUC 0.93 [best threshold 15.0]; femoral TKA components AUC 0.65 [best threshold 15.8]; tibial TKA components AUC 0.86 [best threshold 14.7]). We found strong interrater correlation when assessing SUV max values, with Spearman ρ values ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 and Bland-Altman plots indicating excellent agreement between the two independent observers. Measuring SUV max after 18 F-fluoride PET/CT is a useful adjunct in the diagnostic evaluation for suspected implant loosening after THA and TKA. The method appears to be both accurate and reliable in diagnosing implant loosening for all components except femoral TKA components. In a real-world mixed population with both low-grade infection and aseptic loosening, the method seems to be fairly easy to learn and helpful to subspecialized arthroplasty clinicians. When infection can be ruled out, the method probably performs even better. Further prospective studies are warranted to explore the reason why femoral TKA component loosening was more difficult to ascertain using this novel technique.

Patient- and hospital-related risk factors must be evaluated to prevent PJI. This study identifies influencing factors and differences in infection rates between various types of implant. The basis for the data is the German Arthroplasty Register (EPRD). Septic revisions were calculated with the aid of Kaplan-Meier estimates, with septic revision surgery defined as the primary endpoint. Patients with constrained and unconstrained TKA or UKA were analysed using the Holm multiple log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazard model. The 300,998 cases of knee arthroplasty analysed included 254,144 (84.4%) unconstrained TKA, 9993 (3.3%) constrained TKA and 36,861 (12.3%) UKA, with a maximum follow-up of 7 years. After 1 year, the PJI rate was 0.5% for UKA and 2.8% for TKA, whereas after 7 years it was 4.5% for UKA and 0.9% for TKA (p < 0.0001). In constrained TKA, the PJI rate was significantly increased compared with unconstrained TKA (p < 0.0001). After 1 year, the PJI rate was 2.0% for constrained TKA and 0.8% for unconstrained TKA, as well as 3.1% and 1.4% respectively after 7 years. Implantation of a constrained TKA (HR = 2.55), male sex (HR = 1.84), an increased Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score (HR = 1.18-1.56) and an implantation volume of less than 25 UKA per year (HR = 2.15) were identified as risk factors for revision surgeries; an Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score of 0 (HR = 0.80) was identified as a preventive factor. A reduced implantation volume and constrained knee arthroplasty are linked to a higher risk of PJI. Comorbidities (increased Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score), male sex and a low UKA-implantation volume were identified as risk factors for PJI. Patients who fulfil these criteria need specific infection prevention measures. Further analyses are required to investigate the potential influence of prevention and risk factor modification.

39282002,Cementless Versus Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty of the Same Design: Shorter Operative Times and Minimal Differences in Early Outcomes.,"<i>Introduction:</i> Modern primary cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is increasingly popular, but there is limited evidence on its benefits, early complications, and failures. <i>Purpose</i>: We sought to evaluate operative time, early survivorship, and outcomes of cementless versus cemented TKA of the same design. <i>Methods</i>: As part of this single-center, multisurgeon, retrospective cohort study, we reviewed 598 primary, unilateral TKAs (170 cementless, 428 cemented) of the same design from 2016 to 2018. The cementless cohort was younger (63 vs 67 years) and had more cruciate-retaining implants (17% vs 12%) compared with the cemented cohort. We compared operative time, length of stay, and complications. Survivorship curves were generated via the Kaplan-Meier method. <i>Results</i>: Patients with cementless TKA (using the Triathlon implant, Stryker) had a 24% reduction in operative time (83 vs 109 minutes) but similar length of stay compared with those with cemented TKA (57 vs 61 hours). Cementless TKA had a higher rate of postoperative manipulation for stiffness compared with cemented TKA (8% vs 3%), but there were notable demographic differences between the cohorts. Despite 2 cases (1%) of early cementless tibial aseptic loosening requiring component revision compared with none in the cemented cohort, there was no difference in revision-free survivorship at 2 years (96% and 98%, respectively). <i>Conclusion</i>: This retrospective cohort study found that cementless TKA had a 24% reduction in operative time compared with cemented TKA and similar short-term survivorship. There was a slightly higher rate of aseptic revision and manipulation in the cementless cohort. Further study is warranted on the long-term durability of cemented and cementless TKAs to determine if cementless fixation proves more durable in the midterm to long term.","Puri Simarjeet, Alpaugh Kyle, Chiu Yu-Fen, Ast Michael P, Jerabek Seth, Westrich Geoffrey, Chalmers Brian",HSS journal : the musculoskeletal journal of Hospital for Special Surgery,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39282002/,"Department of Adult Reconstruction and Joint Replacement, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Hip & Knee Replacement, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."
39280965,"Cementless, Cruciate-Retaining Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty Using Conventional Instrumentation: Technical Pearls and Intraoperative Considerations.","Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is commonly indicated for patients with severe tibiofemoral osteoarthritis in whom nonoperative treatment has failed. TKA is one of the most commonly performed orthopaedic surgical procedures in the United States and is associated with substantial improvements in pain, function, and quality of life<sup>1-3</sup>. The procedure may be performed with cemented, cementless, or hybrid cemented and cementless components<sup>4,5</sup>. Cementless TKA utilizing contemporary implant designs has been demonstrated to have excellent long-term survival and outcomes in patients who are appropriately indicated for this procedure<sup>5-8</sup>. The preference of the senior author is to perform this procedure with use of a cruciate-retaining implant design when feasible, and according to the principles of mechanical alignment to guide osseous resection. It should be noted that nearly all recent studies on outcomes following cementless TKA utilize traditional mechanical alignment<sup>7-9</sup>. Alternative alignment strategies, such as gap balancing and kinematic alignment, have not been as well studied in cementless TKA; however, preliminary short-term studies suggest comparable survivorship with restricted kinematic alignment and gap balancing compared with mechanical alignment in patients undergoing cementless TKA<sup>10,11</sup>. Our preferred surgical technique for cementless TKA begins with the patient in the supine position. A thigh tourniquet is applied, and a valgus post is set at the level of the tourniquet. A flexion pad is also placed at 90°, with a bar at 20°. After sterile skin preparation and draping, a time-out is conducted, and the tourniquet is raised. The surgeon makes a medial parapatellar incision, which begins from 1 cm medial to the medial edge of the patella, extending from the tibial tubercle to 2 fingers above the proximal pole of the patella, using a knife and with the knee at 90° of flexion. Scissors are then used to find the fat above the fascia and dissect distally in the same plane. A knife is used to perform a high vastus-splitting, medial parapatellar arthrotomy. Pickups and scissors are then used to perform a partial medial synovectomy, and electrocautery is used to perform a medial peel. As the procedure progresses further medial, the infrapatellar fat pad is excised, followed by the anterior femoral synovial tissue. The surgeon then cuts through the anterior cruciate ligament footprint and origin with the knee flexed before sawing through the tibial spines to decrease the height of the tibial bone block. To prepare the femur, a step drill is inserted into the femoral canal, and the intramedullary alignment guide is placed with the distal femoral cutting guide set to 5° of valgus. The distal femoral cutting guide is then pressed firmly against the distal femur, making sure that the medial side is touching bone, and threaded pins are inserted in the cutting guide under power. The distal femur is then precisely sectioned with use of an oscillating saw equipped with a 21 mm x 90 mm x 1.27-mm saw blade. The surgeon focuses on initiating the cut at the cortices before proceeding further, to avoid cortical blow-out. The resultant cut is meticulously assessed for uniformity and levelness, employing both the alignment rod and the distal cutting guide for verification. Following this assessment, the pins and guide are removed, and any remaining femoral condylar osteophytes are delicately excised with use of a rongeur. The surgeon uses the femoral sizing guide, measures the size of the femur, and double-checks rotation in preparation for the remaining distal femoral cuts. The holes are then drilled to set the rotation for the 4-in-1 cutting guide. When applying the 4-in-1 cutting guide, care is taken to align the guide with the drilled holes in order to avoid inadvertent malrotation. The secure fixation of the block is ensured through the judicious insertion of 2 threaded pins under power at full speed, followed by a more controlled, slower securing process to avoid stripping the threaded pins. Subsequently, the anterior cut is made with the oscillating saw, again with a focus on initiating the cut at the cortices before proceeding further. The posterior cuts are then made in a controlled manner, employing a gentle bouncing technique to facilitate tactile feedback, and keen attention is given to cutting both the medial and lateral cortices of each of the posterior condyles. The anterior chamfer and posterior chamfer are similarly osteotomized. Subsequently, the 4-in-1 cutting guide is gently removed. To complete this phase of the procedure, a curved osteotome and mallet are employed to delicately extract the resected posterior condyles and remove posterior osteophytes as needed. The concave side of the curved osteotome is used with precision to meticulously trace the contours of the condyles, ensuring a precise result. The surgeon places a bump under the knee and extends it to check the medial collateral ligament, quadriceps tendon, patellar tendon, and posterior cruciate ligament to ensure they are intact. To make the tibial cut, the extramedullary alignment guide is placed, and the height of the slot is set to the level of the subchondral bone, aligning the rotation and coronal axis with the 2nd metatarsal. The tibial slope is also set at this step, with the goal of the resection matching the patient's native tibial slope. Matching is usually achieved by visual inspection of the trajectory of the cutting jig, although the stylus can also be utilized to confirm the appropriate tibial slope. The tibial cut is then completed with use of an oscillating saw. A single-sided reciprocating saw is then used to cut perpendicular to the plateau in the medial compartment while making sure not to extend the cut into the unresected portion of the intact tibial plateau. After removal of the medial plateau fragment, a lamina spreader is placed in the medial compartment; this process is repeated with a second cut in a similar fashion in the lateral compartment to create a triangular bone block that fully preserves the insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament. The medial and lateral menisci are resected, and the gaps are checked with use of a spacer block and alignment rod. The surgeon then sizes the tibia and uses their index fingers to feel both medially and laterally for overhang. An alternative approach is to fully expose the tibia in flexion and to size the tibia under complete visualization of the tibial margins. The tibial trial is then pinned in place after ensuring appropriate external rotation and optimal tibial coverage without overhang. The femoral and tibial trial components are placed, and the surgeon tests 7 things: (1) overall varus-valgus alignment in full extension; (2) degree of extension (specifically noting any amount of recurvatum or flexion contracture); (3) flexion to gravity; (4) anteroposterior stability in flexion (using manual anterior-posterior translation of the tibia); (5) varus-valgus stability in extension, mid-flexion, and full flexion with use of a manual dynamic varus-valgus stress test; (6) patellar tracking; and (7) component rotation. At this point, if any of the above checkpoints are not within acceptable tolerances, additional ligamentous releases or cuts may be performed. After the surgeon is satisfied with the positioning and stability of the trial components, the tibial preparation is completed by seating the feet of the tibial bushing into the tray and drilling the tibia, then punching out the keel. The pins and the tray are removed, the retractors are taken out, and the knee is extended. The surgeon then performs a pulse lavage of the femur and tibia with normal saline solution. The final components are opened, attached to the inserters, and placed in plastic coverings. The final tibial baseplate is inserted and impacted, followed by the femoral component in a similar fashion. We ensure that no soft tissue is incarcerated under the components after impaction. A trial bearing is placed, and the knee is extended. The joint space is then bathed in approximately 500 mL of sterile 0.35% povidone-iodine solution, followed by pulsatile lavage with 1 L of sterile isotonic sodium chloride solution without antibiotics. Stability is then tested again, testing the (7) checkpoints previously discussed. At this point, the only modification that can be made is an increase or decrease in the polyethylene component. Our belief is that any additional changes that require removal or repositioning of the previously implanted cementless femoral and tibial components warrant modification to the cemented TKA. Once satisfied with the stability of the real implants and the trial tibial articular surface, the final polyethylene component is inserted. Finally, the tourniquet is released. The surgeon then irrigates the wound again and closes the arthrotomy and skin. Our preference is to utilize a knotless barbed suture for the arthrotomy closure, followed by 2-0 Vicryl (Ethicon) for subcutaneous closure and 2-0 monofilament knotless barbed suture for skin closure. Some surgeons may choose to utilize a non-barbed suture; however, the use of a barbed suture has been shown to be faster and equally as effective as a non-barbed suture in a large meta-analysis of patients undergoing TKA<sup>12</sup>. Before final closure, the peri-incisional iodophor-impregnated antimicrobial incise drape is peeled back, and sterile 10% povidone-iodine is applied to the skin surrounding the incision. After subcuticular closure, adhesive skin glue is applied, followed by a waterproof dressing with the knee in flexion. There are numerous nonoperative treatments available for tibiofemoral osteoarthritis. According to the 2021 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty) Clinical Practice Guideline, these include bracing, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, supervised exercise, patient education, weight loss, and intra-articular corticosteroid injection, among others<sup>13</sup>. When nonoperative treatment has failed, surgical treatment is then indicated for patients who continue to have symptoms that interfere with quality of life. Surgical treatments for tibiofemoral osteoarthritis primarily include unicompartmental knee arthroplasty or TKA, although proximal tibial osteotomy can be performed in some select cases according to disease severity and patient age. Each of these treatments is supported by the recent 2022 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Management of Osteoarthritis of the Knee (Non-Arthroplasty) Clinical Practice Guideline. Historically, the initial generation of cementless TKA implant designs was associated with relatively high rates of failure and poor clinical outcomes when compared with cemented arthroplasty<sup>14,15</sup>. However, there has been a renewed interest in cementless TKA with modern implant designs that incorporate newer biomaterials and porous coatings, with several recent studies demonstrating equivalence to cemented components at short-term, mid-term, and in some studies long-term follow-up<sup>4,6-8</sup>. In a recent study, Kim et al. demonstrated 98% survival free from revision for aseptic loosening at 22 to 25 years postoperatively<sup>7</sup>. In addition to at least equivalent long-term functional outcomes compared with cemented TKA, across multiple studies<sup>4,7</sup>, several short-term benefits of cementless fixation have been reported, including decreased costs and the avoidance of complications associated with cement debris<sup>8,16,17</sup>. Additionally, because there is no need to mix cement, there is a reduced burden of staff training and the elimination of possible variables that may affect cement integrity, in turn leading to improved operative efficiency and shorter operative time<sup>8</sup>. Bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS) has been reported in up to 28% of cases of cemented TKA, and has a substantial risk of morbidity and mortality<sup>16</sup>. Cement debris can also remain in the knee if not retrieved after cement curing and prior to closure<sup>17</sup>, which is believed to cause discomfort and polyethylene wear. This complication is also avoided when cementless implants are utilized. Additional factors leading to our preference for cementless TKA, when indicated, have not yet been proven in the literature but are intuitive concepts. For example, the lack of cement leads to easier removal of components during revision surgery, and preservation of bone stock is important for performing a successful revision TKA. Cementless TKA using modern implant designs has excellent long-term outcomes at up to 25 years. Kim et al. evaluated 261 patients who underwent bilateral simultaneous TKA with random assignment of cemented and cementless components in contralateral knees. In that study, the mean age was 63 years and the mean follow-up was 24 years. The authors found 98% survival without revision for aseptic loosening at 25 years<sup>7</sup>. Similar findings have also been shown in older patients. For example, in a 2022 study by Goh et al., 7-year survivorship of modern implant designs was 100%. In that study of patients >75 years old, 120 cementless TKAs were matched in a 1:3 ratio with TKAs using cemented implants of the same modern design. Ultimately, no difference was seen in final postoperative scores or improvement in scores at 2 years. Seven-year survivorship free from aseptic revision was 99.4% for patients with cemented implants and 100% for patients with cementless implants<sup>4</sup>. When deciding to perform cementless TKA, we consider a variety of preoperative factors, such as a history of osteoporosis, preoperative radiographs showing areas of bone loss, and a history of conditions associated with low bone mineral density.Intraoperative factors can also be considered when deciding between cementless and cemented implants. For example, tactile feedback when sawing can help to determine if bone is hard and sclerotic, which we believe indicates a better candidate for cementless implants.○ Note that during tibial preparation in a varus knee, you will typically have substantial sclerosis of the medial tibial plateau and relative osteopenia in the lateral tibial plateau because of longstanding differences in joint loading. This pattern is reversed in valgus knees.○ In general, we believe that the decision regarding bone integrity should be made primarily on the basis of the non-sclerotic side.With use of the techniques described in the present article, we do not have a preoperative alignment threshold or knee range-of-motion criteria for cementless TKA. More research is needed, however, on the long-term outcomes of cementless TKA when utilizing personalized alignment strategies, which may dictate the placement of components in substantial varus or valgus relative to the anatomic axis.When utilizing keeled tibial implants, we recommend drilling in reverse to pack the walls of the drill hole with bone rather than milling it out, which we believe increases support for bone growth.If there is almost no resistance while drilling in reverse, we believe this to be a poor prognostic sign for cementless TKA, and cementing should be considered.When sizing the tibial baseplate, the goal is to maximize the size of the tibia to fit on top of the rim of cortical bone without overhanging. Undersizing may increase the potential for implant subsidence.Osseous cuts with cementless components need to be perfect. Dome-shaped cuts are at risk for rocking and/or toggling, which could contribute to loosening over time.All 4 quadrants of the tibia should be checked to confirm a flat surface.Soft tissues can get incarcerated under the implant, which is of particular concern for cementless implants as this could impair osseous ingrowth.During trialing, ensure that the trial is completely flush on bone, which is an additional check to guard against toggling and/or loosening.When impacting the femoral component, we recommend applying an extension force so that the weight of the inserter does not pull the component into flexion; however, excessive extension force could also cause a fracture.

39259310,What are the age-related factors linked to aseptic revisions in constrained and unconstrained TKA as well as UKA? A register-based study from the German arthroplasty registry (EPRD).,"The implantation rate of total knee arthroplasties (TKA) is continuously growing. Aseptic problems are a major cause of revision.

Data collection was performed using the German Arthroplasty Registry. Influencing factors were analyzed according to the patients' age and type of procedure. Risk factors were calculated using multiple Log-rank test with the Holm's method. Incidence and comparison of aseptic revisions according to the patients' age and type of procedure were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier-estimates. Cox regression was applied to calculate the hazard ratio. Overall, 300,998 knee arthroplasties with 254,144 (84.4%) unconstrained TKA, 9,993 (3.3%) constrained TKA and 36,861 (12.3%) unicondylar knee arthroplasties (UKA) were analyzed. Patients younger than 65 years suffered a significantly higher aseptic revision rate than older patients (p < 0.0001). After one year, a revision rate of 1.1% was recorded for patients 65-74 years, 1.6% for patients under 65 years, and 1.3% for patients beyond 74 years. After seven years, patients younger than 65 years sustained in 5.0%, patients 65-74 years in 2.9% and patients beyond 74 years in 2.4% revision.

A 70-year-old lady with 12-year post-primary total knee arthroplasty presented with limping gate with radiological evidence of medial femoral bone collapse and implant loosening. After appropriate pre-operative planning, intraoperatively, after the removal of loose femoral implant which had additional bone loss and careful removal of a well-fixed tibial implant and to prevent collapse due to bone loss, Stryker LCCK implant with long stems on both sides was used. Additional screws on the medial femoral end, along with cement to fill the gap. After 5 years of follow-up, the patient is doing well with a painless full range of movement of the knee joint. Preoperatively one should always evaluate for bone loss and infection and compare with the other side.

The aim of this prospective, observational long-term study was the assessment of a completely metal-free ceramic knee replacement system compared to its identical metal counterpart 8 years after implantation, conducted as a follow-up of a previous report. A total of 88 patients (mean age 69 years) were enrolled in this prospective, observational long-term 8-year follow-up study. The ""ceramic group"" with a completely metal-free total knee replacement system was compared to the ""conventional group"" with an identical metal TKA system at the final follow-up.

The tibial/femoral positioning, signs of periprosthetic fissures/fractures or radiolucent lines were documented radiographically. All postoperative clinical scores in the ceramic group primarily improved from baseline to 4-year follow-up, but then decreased at the final 8-year follow-up. At the final follow-up, statistically non-significant differences were found in comparison of both groups for the KSS (ceramic: 166 ± 31, conventional: 162 ± 29; p > 0.05), OKS (ceramic: 37, conventional: 39; p > 0.05), EQ-VAS (ceramic: 77 ± 17, conventional: 72 ± 18; p > 0.05), and HAAS (ceramic: 8.29 ± 3.32, conventional: 9.28 ± 4.44; p > 0.05). A significant difference was found for EQ-5D-L (ceramic: 0.819 ± 0.284, conventional: 0.932 ± 0.126; p ≤ 0.05). Progressive radiolucent lines have been found around the uncemented tibial stem (0.8 mm at initial diagnosis (mean 19 months); 1.3 mm at 4-year follow-up; 1.6 mm at 8-year follow-up) without any clinical signs of loosening. One revision surgery was performed after a traumatic polyethylene inlay-breakage. No allergic reactions could be detected. The used ceramic TKA system meets the functional performance standards of an established identical metal TKA system after an 8-year follow-up period, offering a safe option for patients with prior hypersensitivity reactions to metallic materials. Full cementation of ceramic components is recommended.","Breuer Robert, Fiala Rainer, Hartenbach Florian, Pollok Florian, Huber Thorsten, Strasser-Kirchweger Barbara, Rath Bjoern, Trieb Klemens",Scientific reports,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Female, Aged, Male, Follow-Up Studies, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Prosthesis Design, Quality of Life, Prosthesis Failure, Ceramics, Knee Joint, Aged, 80 and over, Postoperative Complications, Metals, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39251687/,"Department of Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery, Klinik Donaustadt, 1220, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Orthopedics, Klinikum Wels-Grieskirchen, 4600, Wels, Austria.; Department of Psychology, Paris-Lodron University, 5020, Salzburg, Austria.; Department of Orthopedics, Paracelsus Medical University, 5020, Salzburg, Austria. k.trieb@salk.at.; Division for Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Center for Clinical Medicine, Danube Private University, 3500, Krems, Austria. k.trieb@salk.at."
39249136,Short-term survival of the cementless triathlon total knee arthroplasty in a young patient cohort.,"The purpose of this study is to assess the short-term survivorship of a new cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) design in comparison to its cemented predecessor design in a young patient cohort less than 65 years of age. We performed a retrospective cohort study of all primary TKAs (cemented and cementless) in patients under the age of 65 at the time of the index procedure, in a single institution between May 2018 and May 2019. Primary outcome variables included aseptic revision and all-cause revision. Operative time was a secondary variable. Independent variables considered included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, implant type (cruciate-retaining (CR) or posterior-stabilised (PS)) and the use of cemented or cementless implants. There were 106 cemented TKAs and 152 cementless TKAs (Triathlon, Stryker Inc, Mahwah, NJ ) implanted. The minimum follow-up for all cases was 2 years (mean cementless 32.5 months, mean cemented 34.9 months). Of the entire 258 implants only 2 were revised. Both revisions occurred in the cemented cohort for prosthetic joint infection (PJI). The all-cause revision rate in the cementless cohort was 0% compared to 1.8% in the cemented cohort (p = 0.168). Operative times were significantly reduced from 62 min in the cemented cohort to 52.2 min in the cementless cohort (p < 0.001). In a young patient cohort, the cementless Triathlon TKA demonstrates excellent survivorship at short-term follow-up with significant reductions in operative times when compared to the cemented Triathlon TKA.","Sheridan Gerard A, Neufeld Michael E, Howard Lisa C, Garbuz Donald S, Masri Bassam A",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Retrospective Studies, Male, Female, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Prosthesis Design, Reoperation, Adult, Prosthesis Failure, Operative Time, Bone Cements, Age Factors",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39249136/,"Department of Orthopaedics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. sheridga@tcd.ie.; Department of Orthopaedics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."
39248217,A bone graft from the tibial resection or patella that rectified a tibial over-resection reliably healed and improved clinical outcome scores: A retrospective study of kinematically aligned TKA.,"During kinematically aligned (KA) total knee arthroplasty (TKA), the surgeon may need to rectify an over-resection of the medial, lateral or posterior tibia. This study tested the hypothesis that a bone graft taken from the tibial resection or patella and impacted beneath a tibial baseplate would heal, regardless of whether the tibial component and knee were in outlier ranges according to mechanical alignment (MA) criteria. The study also tested the hypothesis that the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS JR) would improve beyond the substantial clinical benefit and that the source and thickness of the bone graft would not influence their improvement. This retrospective study radiographically assessed the healing of a bone graft from the tibial resection (n = 19) or patella (n = 10) in 29 KA TKAs (18 females, mean age 65 years). The tibial component and knee alignment were categorized as in-range or outliers based on reported MA criteria for bone graft healing and implant survival. The one-sample t test identified differences in the improvement of the OKS and KOOS JR from their reported substantial clinical benefit of 16 and 20 points, respectively. At an average follow-up of 37 months, all bone grafts healed even though ≥55% of tibial components and 34% of knees were varus outliers according to MA criteria for bone healing and implant survival. Amongst the 29 patients, the mean OKS and KOOS JR improvements of 25 ± 11 and 47 ± 21 points, respectively, surpassed the threshold of their respective substantial clinical benefit (p < 0.01) and were not influenced by the bone graft's source and thickness (p ≥ 0.51). During cemented KA TKA, the surgeon can use a bone graft from the tibial resection or patella to rectify a tibial over-resection. This technique led to consistent bone healing and improved outcome scores.

39248213,Excellent results of restricted kinematic alignment total knee arthroplasty at a minimum of 10 years of follow-up.,"While restricted kinematic alignment (rKA) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with cemented implants has been shown to provide a similar survivorship rate to mechanical alignment (MA) in the short term, no studies have reported on the long-term survivorship and function. One hundred four consecutive cemented cruciate retaining TKAs implanted using computer navigation and following the rKA principles proposed by Vendittoli were reviewed at a minimum of 10 years after surgery. Implant revisions, reoperations and clinical outcomes were assessed using knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), forgotten joint score (FJS), patients' satisfaction and joint perception questionnaires. Radiographs were analyzed to identify signs of osteolysis and implant loosening. Implant survivorship was 99.0% at a mean follow-up of 11.3 years (range: 10.3-12.9) with one early revision for instability. Patients perceived their TKA as natural or artificial without limitation in 50.0% of cases, and 95.3% were satisfied or very satisfied with their TKA. The mean FJS was 67.6 (range: 0-100). The mean KOOS were as follows: pain 84.7 (range: 38-100), symptoms 85.5 (range: 46-100), function in daily activities 82.6 (range: 40-100), function in sport and recreation 35.2 (range: 0-100) and quality of life 79.1 (range: 0-100). No radiological evidence of implant aseptic loosening or osteolysis was identified.

39239569,Vitamin E-stabilized polyethylene shows similar survival rates at minimum 7-year follow-up compared to conventional polyethylene in primary total knee arthroplasty.,"The aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare survival, clinical and radiographic results of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with vitamin E-stabilized polyethylene (VEPE) or conventional polyethylene (CPE) at a minimum of 7-year follow-up. Patients who underwent primary TKA between 2011 and 2015, receiving the same cemented rotating platform knee design with VEPE or CPE tibial inserts, were identified. Patients were contacted for clinical and radiographic follow-up. American Knee Society Score (KSS), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12), presence of periprosthetic radiolucent lines (RLLs) and osteolysis were evaluated at the last follow-up. Any revision, reintervention or other complications were recorded. Among 350 TKAs initially identified, 102 VEPE and 97 CPE knees were included for analysis with mean follow-up of 8.5 and 8.3 years, respectively. No significant difference was found in survival rates at 10-year follow-up with revision due to aseptic loosening (95.0% vs. 97.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.29) or due to any reason (87.6% vs. 89.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.78) between VEPE and CPE TKA. KSS function score resulted significantly higher in the VEPE group over CPE (77 vs. 63, <i>p</i> = 0.01). RLLs were more frequent in VEPE than CPE (54% vs. 32%, <i>p</i> = 0.05), mainly noticed medially and posteriorly beneath the tibial plate, adjacent to the trochlear shield and the posterior condyles.

The patient, a 69-year-old female with a complex medical history including dementia, Ménière's syndrome, and left total knee arthroplasty, presented to the emergency department with AMS whereupon a left PPKD was discovered. Less than three weeks before this presentation, she sustained a left PPKD during a previous admission. During her current admission, she sustained yet another left PPKD after trials of closed reduction and immobilization. The patient eventually underwent a left cemented revision total knee arthroplasty with a hinged prosthesis. The implant was noted to be stable, and the patient had minimal pain postoperatively with no vascular or neurological injury. Upon outpatient follow-up, the patient reported doing well. There have been few documented cases of recurrent or chronic PPKD in individuals with AMS or restricted intellect. These comorbidities create a complex approach to diagnosing and treating the aforementioned orthopedic injury, and as this injury can have devastating consequences, quickly and effectively delivering diagnosis and treatment is vital. This case highlights the importance of early identification, risk factors, preoperative management, and appropriate operative course for patients with AMS and recurrent PPKDs.","Delgadillo Blake E, Buchman Zachary J, Brown Aaron, Federico Justin R",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39221301/,"Orthopaedic Surgery, Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, Bradenton, USA.; Internal Medicine, Baptist Health, Jacksonville, USA."
39216863,Outcomes of fixed versus mobile-bearing medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.,"The optimal bearing surface design for medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of fixed-bearing (FB) and mobile-bearing (MB) UKAs from a single high-volume institution. Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all primary cemented medial UKAs performed by seven surgeons from January 2006 to December 2022. A total of 2,999 UKAs were identified, including 2,315 FB and 684 MB cases. The primary outcome measure was implant survival. Secondary outcomes included 90-day and cumulative complications, reoperations, component revisions, conversion arthroplasties, range of motion, and patient-reported outcome measures. Overall mean age at surgery was 65.7 years (32.9 to 94.3), 53.1% (1,593/2,999) of UKAs were implanted in female patients, and demographics between groups were similar (p > 0.05). The mean follow-up for all UKAs was 3.7 years (0.0 to 15.6). Using revision for any reason as an endpoint, five-year survival for FB UKAs was 97.2% (95% CI 96.4 to 98.1) compared to 96.0% for MB (95% CI 94.1 to 97.9; p = 0.008). The FB group experienced fewer component revisions (14/2,315, 0.6% vs 12/684, 1.8%; p < 0.001) and conversion arthroplasties (38/2315, 1.6% vs 24/684, 3.5%; p < 0.001). A greater number of MB UKAs underwent revision due to osteoarthritis progression (FB = 21/2,315, 0.9% vs MB = 16/684, 2.3%; p = 0.003). In the MB group, 12 (1.8%) subjects experienced bearing dislocations which required revision surgery. There were 15 early periprosthetic tibia fractures (0.6%) in the FB group compared to 0 for MB (p = 0.035). In similar patient populations, FB UKAs demonstrated slightly higher survival than a commonly used MB design. Adverse event profiles differed by bearing type, with an increased risk of bearing dislocation and OA progression with MB designs, and early periprosthetic tibia fractures for FB designs.","Fricka Kevin B, Wilson Eric J, Strait Alexander V, Ho Henry, Hopper Robert H, Hamilton William G, Sershon Robert A",The bone & joint journal,"Humans, Female, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Design, Middle Aged, Reoperation, Aged, 80 and over, Prosthesis Failure, Adult, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Range of Motion, Articular, Treatment Outcome, Retrospective Studies, Postoperative Complications, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Prospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39216863/,"Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute, Alexandria, Virginia, USA."
39206056,Outcomes of Lower Extremity Total Joint Arthroplasty in Patients With Skeletal Dysplasia: A Systematic Review.,"Patients with genetic skeletal dysplasias often require lower extremity total joint arthroplasty (TJA) due to early joint degeneration; however, little data exists regarding the outcomes of TJA in this population. Our purpose was to review the literature to determine the complication rates, revision rates, implant survivorship, and patient-reported outcomes of total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty (THA) in those with genetic skeletal dysplasias. A systematic literature review of online databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) was conducted. Studies that reported the outcomes of THA or total knee arthroplasty in patients with genetically confirmed skeletal dysplasias were included. Case reports and studies that defined dysplasia based on height alone were excluded. Fourteen studies met the criteria for data extraction and analysis. Our review yielded a sample of 596 skeletal dysplasia patients with a median follow-up of 6.01 years (1.7-15.9). Mean age was 54.04 years, and mean body mass index was 29.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Cementless fixation was utilized in 65.7% of THAs, while all knees were cemented. Hip implant survivorship was 79% at 10 years and 56% at 20 years. Knee implant survivorship was 92% at 10 years and 46% at 20 years. Hip and knee revisions were 15.3% and 13.5%, respectively. The most common indication was aseptic loosening and polyethylene wear. Patient-reported outcomes improved across all domains. The literature regarding lower extremity TJA in those with genetic skeletal dysplasias demonstrates appropriate 10-year implant survivorship and improvement in patient-reported outcomes across all survey domains.","Guirguis Paul, Fowler Lucas, Ricciardi Benjamin F",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39206056/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Center for Musculoskeletal Research, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, NY."
39186613,Effect of Adding Stem Extension to a Short-Keeled Knee Implant on the Risk of Tibial Loosening: a Historical Cohort Study.,"Short-keeled tibial implants may be at higher risk of aseptic loosening. Stem augmentation has been suggested to improve its fixation. We aimed to assess whether this technique could decrease the loosening rate of such tibial implants. We retrospectively studied the knees receiving stemmed versus nonstemmed versions of a short-keeled prosthesis. A total of 932 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty using a Persona prosthesis with >24-month follow-up (mean 53.7) were included, of whom 212 were at high risk of loosening due to osteoporosis or high body mass index (BMI). The rate of tibial aseptic loosening in high-risk patients and in the whole cohort was compared between those with and without stem extension. Multivariable analysis was conducted to identify the risk factors of loosening. In the whole cohort, in 203 knees (21.8%), a cemented short stem was used, versus 729 knees (78.2%) without. The tibial implant revision rates for loosening were 2.06% and 0.99% for nonstemmed and stemmed cases, respectively ( P = 0.551). When the cohort was categorized based on the loosening risk factors, the loosening risk was significantly higher in the high-risk than in the low-risk group, regardless of stem status (log-rank test = 8.1, hazard ratio = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.78, 2.57, P = 0.005). 212 patients were at high risk of loosening, due to high BMI or osteoporosis, among whom the risk of aseptic loosening was higher when a stem was not used (log-rank = 32.1, hazard ratio = 4.95, 95% CI = 4.05, 5.86, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, osteoporosis, BMI ≥35, and smoking were correlated with loosening. The failure rate was markedly lower in the stemmed group of the patients at elevated risk of aseptic loosening due to osteoporosis and/or high BMI. In the entire cohort, the risk of loosening in stemmed tibial implants was similar to the nonstemmed group. The findings support a protective role for the stem in patients at high risk of failure of the cemented tibial implant.

39185400,Total Knee Arthroplasty in a Patient With Neurofibromatosis 1.,"Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a rare genetic syndrome that leads to the development of neurofibromas and increases the risk of malignancy, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Patients with NF1 often have other orthopaedic manifestations, including short stature, osteopenia, and dysplasia. A 47-year-old patient with a history of NF1 and multiple neurofibromas of the right lower extremity presented with a severe valgus deformity, instability, and osteoarthritis of the right knee that was debilitating to daily life. Over time, the patient lost proprioception and potentially some sensation to the right knee with neurofibroma formation, leading to the development of Charcot arthropathy of the right knee with secondary osteoarthritis. The preoperative workup consisted of a magnetic resonance imaging of the knee to confirm no malignancy was present and templating to ensure the standard implant size was amenable for the patient. A primary total knee arthroplasty was performed with a cemented-stemmed hinged knee implant. At 6 months post-surgery, the patient had a dramatic improvement in her pain and quality of life.","Hodo Thomas, Sherman William, Sanchez Santiago, Anudu Edmund, Sanchez Fernando",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39185400/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, USA."

39171362,Randomized Controlled Trial of a Novel Cementless vs. Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty: Early Clinical and Radiographic Outcomes.,"Previous cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) designs faced challenges with insufficient initial fixation on tibial side, resulting in inferior functional outcomes and survival rates. The Zoned Trabecular Bone Cementless Knee is a novel implant designed for cementless TKA which aims to achieve excellent initial fixation, promoting effective osseointegration. The aim of this research was to compare the early clinical and radiographic results of this cementless TKA with cemented TKA. Between September 2021 and April 2022, 64 patients (64 knees) were recruited in this prospective randomized controlled trial to receive either cementless 3D-printed trabecular metal TKA or a cemented posterior stabilized TKA. Preoperative and postoperative clinical evaluations, including the range of motion (ROM), Knee Society Score (KSS), and the Reduced Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities Score (WOMAC), were conducted and analyzed for comparison. Radiographs and computed tomography scans were utilized to assess the initial fixation. The complications between the two groups were also recorded and compared. Continuous data were analyzed for significance using independent-samples t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test and categorical data were analyzed using chi-squared or Fisher's exact test. Both groups demonstrated significant enhancement at 12 months follow-up in the ROM compared with baseline (ROM: 94.7 ± 23.4 vs. 113.1 ± 12.3 in cementless group and 96.5 ± 14.7 vs. 111.0 ± 12.8 in cemented group, p < 0.05). However, no statistical differences were observed between the two groups in postoperative ROM, KSS, or WOMAC score. The radiographs and computed tomography scans showed similar results, including radiolucent lines and osteolysis in either femoral or tibial. Additionally, there was no statistical difference in the overall complication rate between the two groups. Notably, one patient in the cementless TKA group required revision for periprosthetic infection as the end point. This novel 3D-printed trabecular metal cementless TKA achieved comparable clinical outcomes and initial fixation to cemented TKA in early stage. Longer-term examination is necessary to validate these results.","Zhao Enze, Zhu Xiaoyan, Tang Haiwei, Luo Zhenyu, Zeng Weinan, Zhou Zongke",Orthopaedic surgery,"Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Bone Cements, Knee Prosthesis, Printing, Three-Dimensional, Prospective Studies, Prosthesis Design, Range of Motion, Articular",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39171362/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, West China Hospital, West China Medical School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China.; West China School of Nursing, Sichuan University/Department of Orthopedics, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."
39157416,The influence of implant factors on patient outcomes in primary total knee arthroplasty.,"The influence of implant factors on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has previously been studied but findings are often inconsistent, restricted in scope and biased by confounding factors. This study aims to determine the association between implant-related factors and early post-operative PROMs after TKA. Using data from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) PROMs program, the study included 9487 primary TKA procedures performed in 43 hospitals from July 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020. Data included baseline demographic data, surgical details and PROMs collected pre- and 6 months post-operatively. Seven prosthesis characteristics were incorporated in the multivariable model, with proportional odds ordinal regression analysis used to assess their effects on post-operative Oxford knee score (OKS) and joint pain. Adjustments were made for pre-operative OKS and joint pain, as well as potential patient confounders. At six months, fixed bearing implants showed higher odds of better OKS compared to mobile bearing implants (odds ratio [OR] = 1.20, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.37. p < 0.004). Similar findings were found with the use of image derived instrumentation (IDI) (OR = 1.27, 95 % CI 1.11-1.46, p < 0.001), robotic assisted vs. non-navigated knees (OR = 1.21, 95 % CI 1.06-1.38, p < 0.005) and no patella resurfacing (OR = 1.10, 95 % CI 1.01-1.20, p < 0.032). For lower pain scores at six months, the use of highly crosslinked polyethylene (OR = 1.12, 95 % CI 1.02-1.22, p < 0.015), cemented femoral components (OR = 1.11, 95 % CI 1.01-1.22, p < 0.024), IDI (OR = 1.20, 95 % CI 1.05-1.37, p < 0.009) or no patella resurfacing (OR = 1.10, 95 % CI 1.01-1.20, p < 0.034) were associated.

39127311,Survivorship of Modern Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty: Analysis From the Canadian Joint Replacement Registry.,"Cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is rising in popularity. The literature supporting its use over cemented TKA remains sparse. Using the Canadian Joint Replacement Registry (CJRR), we sought to investigate cementless versus cemented fixation in modern primary TKA and (1) determine whether there is an overall difference in revision by fixation, (2) perform a subanalysis of the most-commonly used cementless TKA brand in Canada, and (3) identify the reasons for revision. The CJRR data was used to analyze TKA designs with cemented and cementless versions. Revision risk is reported as all-cause cumulative percent revision (CPR). Reasons for revision were analyzed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to report adjusted hazard ratios (HR) controlling for age, sex, patella resurfacing, and bearing constraints. We included 202,880 primary TKAs performed between 2012 and 2021. Of those, 9,163 (4.5%) were cementless. The CPR at 8 years was 4.49% for cementless and 3.14% for cemented implants. After adjusting for confounders, we did not detect a difference in revision risk overall (HR 0.87 [95% CI (confidence interval) 0.73 to 1.04], P = 0.128). However, the most commonly used cementless TKA brand demonstrated a CPR of 1.95% compared to 2.19% for its cemented version at 4 years. Furthermore, we detected a significantly lower revision risk compared to its cemented version after adjusting for confounders (HR 0.66 [95% CI 0.51 to 0.85], P = 0.001). The 4 most common reasons for revision in both groups were the following: (1) infection, (2) instability, (3) aseptic loosening, and (4) pain of unknown origin. Using CJRR data adjusted for confounding factors, no difference in revision risk was detected between cemented and cementless implants overall. However, for the most common brand of cementless TKA used in Canada, there was a lower risk of revision than its corresponding cemented version. The reasons for revision were similar.","Chen Aaron G, Sogbein Olawale A, McCalden Richard W, Bohm Eric R, Lanting Brent A",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Female, Registries, Reoperation, Aged, Canada, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Prosthesis Failure, Prosthesis Design, Bone Cements, Aged, 80 and over",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39127311/,"Division of Orthopaedic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London Health Sciences Centre, University Hospital, London, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Orthopaedics, Department of Surgery, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; Concordia Hip and Knee Institute, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada."
39104660,Navigation-Assisted One-Stage Total Knee Arthroplasty With Extra-Articular Corrective Osteotomy for Knee Osteoarthritis With Femoral and Tibial Extra-Articular Deformity: A Case Report.,"<b>Background:</b> Knee osteoarthritis (OA) with extra-articular deformity (EAD) is a rare condition for which achieving accurate alignment with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is difficult. Extra-articular corrective osteotomy may be necessary for severe deformities. <b>Case Presentation:</b> A 76-year-old man underwent TKA for knee OA with EAD due to malunion after fractures of the femur and tibia. The femoral varus and the tibial valgus/recurvatum deformities were mild and corrected by intra-articular osteotomy using navigation (i.e., navigation-assisted standard TKA). However, the femoral antecurvatum deformity was severe, and we performed extra-articular corrective osteotomy simultaneously with TKA. Navigation was used not only for TKA but also for extra-articular corrective osteotomies. The osteotomy site was fixed with a cemented stem and metaphyseal sleeve. The postoperative hip-knee-ankle angle was 1° varus, the femoral implant was implanted at 0.5° varus/0.5° flexion, and the tibial implant was implanted at 0.5° varus/0° posterior slope. Two years after surgery, improvements were obtained in the range of motion from 15°-95° to 0°-110°, the Knee Society Score from 39 to 92 points, and the functional score from 35 to 100 points. <b>Conclusions:</b> One-stage TKA with extra-articular corrective osteotomy achieved good clinical results due to accurate alignment using navigation and firm fixation of the osteotomy site using cemented-stem and metaphyseal sleeve without any fixation devices.","Kubo Mitsuhiko, Hirobe Sho, Maeda Tsutomu, Kumagai Kosuke, Amano Yasutaka, Nosaka Yuki, Hasegawa Takahide, Imai Shinji",Case reports in orthopedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39104660/,"Department of Sports and Musculoskeletal Medicine Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta, Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga 520-2192, Japan.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta, Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga 520-2192, Japan."
39095924,Is there an increased revision rate due to early tibial component loosening with a modern total knee arthroplasty design? A retrospective analysis from a large volume arthroplasty centre.,"The Attune TKR was introduced in 2011 as a successor to its predicate design The PFC Sigma. However, following reports of early failures, there are ongoing concerns related to increased loosening rates. Given the concerns, this study aimed to compare revision rates of the Attune implant to an established predicate, and other implant designs used in a high-volume arthroplasty center. We identified 10,202 patients who underwent primary cemented TKR at our institution with a minimum of 1 year follow-up, involving 2406 Attune TKR (557 S +), 4642 PFC TKR, 3154 other designs. Primary outcomes were revision for all-causes, aseptic loosening of any component, and aseptic tibial loosening. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression models were used to compare groups. Matched cohorts were selected for radiographic analysis. 308 knees were revised. The Attune cohort had the lowest risk of revision, with a rate of 2.98 per 1000 implant-years while the PFC and All Other Implant groups had a rate of 3.15 and 4.4 respectively. Aseptic loosing was the most common cause for revision, with 76% (65/88) involving the tibia. Survival analysis showed no significant differences between the Attune and other cohorts. Radiolucent lines were detected in 7.1% of the Attune S + group, 6.8% of the standard Attune group, and 6.3% of the PFC group, with no significant differences found between them. This study represents the largest non-registry review of the Attune TKR in comparison to a predicate and other designs. There was no significant increased revision rate for all-cause revision or aseptic loosening, or peri-implant radiolucencies. It appears that increased loosening may not be as concerning as originally thought.

The aim was to assess ten-year implant survival and functional outcomes of a cemented single-radius TKA with a CS insert, performed without posterior cruciate ligament sacrifice. This retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients undergoing TKA at a specialist centre in the UK between November 2010 and December 2012. Data were collected using a bespoke electronic database and cross-referenced with national arthroplasty audit data, with variables including: preoperative characteristics, intraoperative factors, complications, and mortality status. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were collected by a specialist research team at ten years post-surgery. There were 536 TKAs, of which 308/536 (57.5%) were in female patients. The mean age was 69.0 years (95% CI 45.0 to 88.0), the mean BMI was 32.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI 18.9 to 50.2), and 387/536 (72.2%) survived to ten years. There were four revisions (0.7%): two deep infections (requiring debridement and implant retention), one aseptic loosening, and one haemosiderosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated no difference in implant survival according to sex, age, or obesity status. Ten-year PROMs were available for 196/387 (50.6%) surviving patients and were excellent: mean Oxford Knee Score 34.4 (95% CI 32.7 to 36.1); mean Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) 51.2 (95% CI 16.1 to 86.3); mean EuroQol five-dimension five-level questionnaire score 69.9 (95% CI 46.8 to 93.0); 141/196 (71.9%) achieved the 22-point FJS patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS); and 156/196 (79.6%) were ""very satisfied or satisfied"". This is the only large study reporting ten-year implant survival and functional outcomes of TKA using a cemented single-radius design and with a CS tibial bearing construct.

39084604,Survivorship of Primary NexGen Knee Replacement: Comparing Cementless Trabecular Metal to Other Designs of Tibial Component.,"The impact of cementless trabecular metal (TM) implants on implant survivorship are not well delineated. This study compares primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) revision rates of cemented knee replacements with two cementless knee replacement designs-cementless TM and a non-TM cementless design. Data from a national registry queried TKA procedures performed for osteoarthritis from 1999 to 2020. The risk of revision of Zimmer NexGen TKA using cementless TM, cementless non-TM, and cemented non-TM were compared. Analyses included Kaplan-Meier estimates of survivorship and Cox hazard ratios (HR), stratified by age and gender. Cementless TM components had higher risks of revision compared with cementless non-TM implants (HR = 1.49; <i>p</i> ≤ 0.001). Cementless TM implants showed higher risks of revision compared with cemented non-TM prostheses for the first 2 years (HR = 1.75, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Non-TM prostheses posed equal risk of revision for cementless and cemented fixations (HR = 0.95, <i>p</i> = 0.522). Patients aged 55 to 64 years and 65 to 74 years had a higher risk of revision for cementless TM compared with cementless non-TM (HR = 1.40, <i>p</i> = 0.033 and HR = 1.79, <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively) and cemented non-TM implants (HR = 1.51, <i>p</i> < 0.001 and HR = 1.54, <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively). The study shows there is an increased risk of revision with TM cementless implants for patients aged 55 to 74 years.

39069272,Use of Hinged Implants for Multi-Stage Revision Knee Arthroplasty for Severe Periprosthetic Joint Infection: Remission Rate and Outcomes After a Minimum Follow-Up of Five Years.,"In severe periprosthetic joint infection after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), multistage procedures are indicated for ongoing signs of infection after implant removal during the spacer interval of an intended 2-stage exchange. In these cases, several additional debridement and spacer exchange surgeries may be necessary. Herein, we analyzed the complications, remission rates, and functional outcomes after multistage revision arthroplasty using hinged TKAs. Patients (n = 79) treated with multistage revision arthroplasty after chronic periprosthetic joint infection of the knee were included (2010 to 2018). During the prosthesis-free interval, a static spacer containing antibiotic-loaded bone cement was implanted. The mean number of surgeries, including implant removal and revision arthroplasty, was 3.8 (range, 3 to 8). The mean duration from implant removal to revision arthroplasty was 83 days (range, 49 to 318). Complications, remission, and mortality were analyzed after a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Outcomes were assessed based on the Knee Society Score (KSS) and the Western Ontario McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index. During follow-up, 24 (30.4%) patients underwent revision surgery, with a mean time to surgical revision of 99 weeks (range, 1 to 261). After follow-up, the infection-free remission rate and overall mortality were 87.3 and 11.4%, respectively. The mean KSS was 74.3 (range, 24 to 99), the KSS Function Score was 60.8 (range, 5 to 100), and the Western Ontario McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index 30.2 (range, 5 to 83). In difficult-to-treat cases, multistage revision arthroplasty showed high remission rates and low mortality after a follow-up of 5 years. The overall revision rate was comparably high, accounting for early and late reinfections most of the time. In cases of implant survival, functional outcomes comparable to those of revision hinge TKA reported in the literature can be achieved. Therefore, multistage procedures with additional debridement steps should be performed in cases of ongoing infections in intended 2-stage procedures.","Schnetz Matthias, Ewald Larissa, Jakobi Tim, Klug Alexander, Hoffmann Reinhard, Gramlich Yves",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Prosthesis-Related Infections, Reoperation, Male, Female, Aged, Middle Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Follow-Up Studies, Treatment Outcome, Aged, 80 and over, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Debridement, Retrospective Studies, Knee Joint, Bone Cements, Remission Induction, Device Removal",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39069272/,"Department of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, Berufsgenossenschaftliche Unfallklinik Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany."
39068461,Biomechanical analysis of patient specific cone vs conventional stem in revision total knee arthroplasty.,"In revision total knee arthroplasty, addressing significant bone loss often involves the use of cemented or press-fit stems to ensure implant stability and long-term fixation. A possible alternative to stem was recently introduced utilizing custom-made porous metaphyseal cones, designed to reconstruct the missing tibial and femoral geometries. Early clinical and radiological assessments have shown promising results. The objective of this research was to biomechanically evaluate the performances of these custom-made cones. The biomechanical study was conducted using a validated finite element model. The bone geometries of a patient (selected for their history of four knee revisions due to infection and periprosthetic fractures, followed by a successful treatment with custom-made 3D-printed metaphyseal cones) were employed for the study. On these bone models, different revision scenarios were simulated and examined biomechanically: (A) custom-made cementless metaphyseal cones; (B) cemented stems; (C) press-fit stems; (D) distal femoral reconstruction with press-fit stem. All the models were analyzed at 0 °and 90 °of flexion, under physiological load conditions simulating daily activities; stress distribution, average Von-Mises stresses and risk of fracture were then analyzed and compared among configurations. The use of custom-made 3D-printed cones exhibited the most favorable stress distribution in both femoral and tibial bones. Tibial bone stress was evenly distributed in custom-made cone configurations, while stress concentration was observed in distal regions for the other scenarios. Additionally, custom-made cones displayed overall homogeneity and lower stress levels, potentially contributing to limit pain. Symmetrical stress distribution was observed between the lateral and medial proximal tibia in custom-made cone models, whereas other scenarios exhibited uneven stress, particularly in the anterior tibial bone. The biomechanical analysis of porous custom-made metaphyseal cones in re-revision arthroplasties is in agreement with the positive clinical and radiological outcomes. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of using custom-made cones, which offer more uniform stress distribution and may contribute to improve patient outcomes in revision TKA procedures. Further studies in this direction are warranted to validate these biomechanical findings.","Piovan Gianluca, Bori Edoardo, Padalino Marika, Pianigiani Silvia, Innocenti Bernardo",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Biomechanical Phenomena, Reoperation, Finite Element Analysis, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Design, Printing, Three-Dimensional, Tibia, Femur",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39068461/,"Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatology, S.

39067854,"Contact Dermatitis From Biomedical Devices, Implants, and Metals-Trouble From Within.","Allergic contact dermatitis is characterized by its appearance of red, raised and infiltrated, scaling or scabbed skin and intense pruritus, and distinguished from irritant contact dermatitis by its specific immune process and histopathology. Many contact allergens are low-molecular- weight chemicals including metals such as nickel, cobalt, and chromium, preservatives, and adhesives. When such materials are used internally in biomedical devices, they are similarly capable of causing sensitization and an inflammatory response. Sometimes, the reaction remains internal, and presents as swelling, pain, stiffness, decreased range of motion, and internal itching around the implant. Such reactions may, in some cases, also extend to include a localized or, rarely, systemic contact dermatitis indicative of the same process. This review will present an overview of reported skin and local internal reactions to orthopedic implants, which are the largest category of implanted internal metal devices. Immune reactions to smaller categories of medical appliances include cardiac devices and vascular stents, neuromodulation devices, diabetic appliances, Nuss bar surgery for pectus excavatum, and dental and spinal implants.

39059548,Comparison of survival between cemented vs cementless unicompartimental knee arthroplasty: a case control study with propensity score matching.,"The first results of cementless prosthesis were rather disappointing. However recent progress in methods of cementless fixation of prosthesis should lead to better results in terms of survival of these prostheses. The main objective is to compare the survival rate at last follow-up of UKA with cemented tibial or cementless. We hypothesize that UKAs with uncemented tibial implants have better survival compared to UKAs with cemented tibial implants. This single center case-control study included 94 medial UKA with a cemented tibial component that were paired by propensity score matching to 94 medial UKA with a uncemented tibial component. The main evaluation criterion was the comparison of the survivorship of the UKA between a cemented tibial implant and those with a cementless tibial implant in terms of all-cause revision surgery at last follow-up. The secondary endpoints were the analysis of the causes of failure. The mean final follow-up was 6.1years (2.3). The overall survival rate in our serie of medial UKA was 92.4% [88.7%-96.3%] at five years. The overall survival rate in cemented group was and 91.5% [86.0%-97.3%] at five years and at 93.2% [88.1%-98.7%] at five years, in the uncemented group.

39059126,Effects of implant precoating and fat contamination on the stability of the tibial baseplate.,"Approximately 5% of primary total knee arthroplasty patients require revision within 10 years, often due to distal component loosening. Application of a thin layer of PMMA cement as precoating on the tibial component aims to prevent aseptic loosening. This study investigates the impact of precoating and fat contamination on tibial baseplate stability. Two groups of NexGen® stemmed tibial implants (size 4) were studied: Option implants (N = 12) and PMMA Precoat implants (N = 12). Each implant design was divided into two subgroups, (N = 6), with one subgroup featuring bone marrow fat at the implant-cement interface and the other without contamination. In a mechanical testing machine, the implants underwent uniaxial loading for 20,000 cycles, while recording vertical micromotion and migration of the tibial baseplates. Subsequently, a push-out test assessed fixation strength at the cement interfaces. Results were compared using non-parametric statistics and presented as median and min-to-max ranges. Option implants exhibited higher micromotion in dry conditions compared to precoated implants (p = 0.03). Under contamination, both designs demonstrated similar micromotion values. Fixation strength did not significantly differ between designs under dry, uncontaminated conditions (p > 0.99). However, under contaminated conditions, the failure load for the non-coated Option implant was nearly half that of the uncontaminated counterparts (3517 N, 2603-4367 N vs 7531 N, 5163-9000 N; p = 0.002). Precoat implants displayed less susceptibility to fat contamination (p = 0.30).

The hypothesis was that the raw surgical site infection (SSI) rate is lower when this particular cement is used in comparison with cement loaded with standard-dose gentamicin during rTHA or rTKA for aseptic reasons. This retrospective study included 290 consecutive patients undergoing aseptic rTHA or rTKA. Two consecutive cohorts were defined: the first (control group) involved 145 patients where ALBC with gentamicin only was used; the second (study group) involved 145 patients where ALBC with high-dose gentamicin and clindamycin was used. The primary endpoint was the raw SSI rate after 24 months. The raw SSI rate was 8/145 (6%) in the control group and 13/145 (9%) in the study group (odds ratio 0.62, p = 0.26). There was a significant impact of the presence of any risk factor on the SSI rate (15/100 versus 6/169, odds ratio = 4.25, p = 0.002), but no significant impact of any individual risk factor.

39047324,Biomechanical study of effect of tibial posteromedial defect depth and area on primary TKA implant stability.,"Medial tibial defects are common in patients who underwent primary total knee arthroplasty for varus deformity. Previous clinical studies have categorized tibial defects according to the depth of the defects and recommended different ways of addressing them. This study aimed to perform a biomechanical FE analysis to investigate the role of depth and surface area of the medial tibial plateau defects in the stability of the tibial component in primary TKA implants. Forty posteromedial tibial defect models with eight different depths (including 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, and 18 mm) and five different surface areas (including 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% medial surface involvement) were used to create the FE models. Loads were applied to ellipses on tibial tray with 70-30% mediolateral distribution. The resulting relative motion of the bone and implant was measured to evaluate the tibial tray instability. For defects with less than 20% surface involvement, the amount of relative motion had a moderately increasing fashion; however, in more significant percentages of surface involvement of the medial tibial plateau, especially in 50%, the graphs revealed a nonlinear increasing pattern which means that the depth would affect the amount of relative motion only when defect area is large. In defects with less than 20% surface involvement approaches like graft and cement augmentation would suffice whereas it would be essential to consider a more appropriate method like stem or metal augments for defects with more than 20% of medial surface involvement as the instability increased nonlinearly.","Nourishirazi Reza, Firoozabadi Mohammad Ayati, Hassanzadeh Mehdi, Toofan Hesam, Karimpour Morad, Mortazavi Seyed Mohammad Javad",The Knee,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Tibia, Biomechanical Phenomena, Knee Prosthesis, Joint Instability, Knee Joint, Finite Element Analysis, Male, Range of Motion, Articular",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39047324/,"School of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.; Orthopedic Surgery Department of IKHC, Joint Reconstruction Centre, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Joint Reconstruction Research Centre, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Joint Reconstruction Research Centre, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Orthopedic Surgery Department of IKHC, Joint Reconstruction Centre, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Joint Reconstruction Research Centre, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

39035847,Comprehensive evaluation of risk factors for aseptic loosening in cemented total knee arthroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Aseptic loosening is the most common cause for revisions after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Despite many studies exploring various risk factors associated with aseptic loosening, findings often present inconsistencies. To address this, we conducted a thorough review of the literature to identify and analyse these risk factors in cemented TKA. Additionally, we performed a meta-analysis to reconcile the divergent conclusions observed across studies. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Embase from 1996 up to 2024 and evaluated the quality of the included literature. Seventy-four studies were included to assess the association of BMI, diabetes, high physical activity (HPA), osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cement material and implant design. Twenty-nine studies were used to calculate relative risk and CIs (using the random effects theory) and study heterogeneity for six different risk factors (BMI, diabetes, HPA level, cement material, polyethylene and implant design). Patients with diabetes are eight times more likely to experience aseptic loosening compared to those without diabetes (RR = 9.18, 95% CI: 1.80-46.77, <i>p</i> < 0.01). The use of tibial stem extension or highly crosslinked polyethylene can help reduce the incidence of aseptic loosening. However, we did not identify BMI, HPA, osteoporosis, RA, the use of high-viscosity cement and the utilization of mobile-bearing designs as risk factors for aseptic loosening post-cemented TKA. Patients with diabetes undergoing TKA should be counselled regarding their potential increased risk of aseptic loosening. The use of tibial stem extensions and HXLPE can mitigate the incidence of aseptic loosening in cemented TKA. However, given a limited number of studies were included in the meta-analysis, we believe that higher-level studies are necessary to clearly identify other risk factors.

39035220,Robotic-arm-assisted conversion of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty to total knee arthroplasty.,"The purpose of this study was to describe a novel robotic-arm-assisted UKA to TKA conversion technique and evaluate the patient reported and clinical outcomes in these patients. A retrospective review between 2017 and 2022 was conducted of patients that underwent robotic-arm-assisted UKA to TKA conversion. Charts were reviewed for patient demographics, indications for conversion from UKA to TKA, operative technique, implants used, postoperative complications, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The surgical technique resembles that of primary TKA, with the major exception of registering the robotic arm with retained UKA implants and removing the implants only when verification is complete. There were 44 robotic-arm-assisted UKAs in 41 patients were included in the study. Indications for UKA conversion to TKA included: 33 patients who had osteoarthritis progression (75%), 7 aseptic loosening (16%), 2 unspecified pain (4.5%), 1 polyethylene wear (2.3%), and 1 prosthetic joint infection (2.3%). Uncemented cruciate-retaining (CR) implants were used in 38 of the 44 robotic-arm-assisted TKAs (86.5%). The other six utilized cemented implants: four CR femurs (9.1%), six tibial baseplates (13.6%), four tibial stems (9.1%), and four medial tibial augments (9.1%). The PROMs significantly improved at 1-year follow-up, with the average KOOS JR score increasing from 48.1 to 68.7 (<i>P</i> < 0.001), and the r-WOMAC score decreasing from 25.7 to 10.6 (<i>P</i> = 0.003). Two patients developed prosthetic joint infections (4.5%), one developed aseptic loosening of the femoral component (2.3%), and one developed a superficial surgical site infection requiring superficial irrigation and debridement (2.3%). Overall survivorship was 93.18% at 1.8 years, and aseptic survivorship was 97.73%. Robotic-arm-assisted UKA to TKA conversion exhibited improved patient-reported outcomes and low revision and complication rates. Improved implant placement achieved with robotic-arm-assistance may improve the functional and clinical outcomes following these surgeries.","Magruder Matthew L, McClure Tanner, Marchand Kevin, Mont Michael A, Marchand Robert C",Journal of orthopaedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39035220/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.; Ortho Rhode Island, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Warwick, RI, USA.; The Rubin Institute for Advanced Orthopedics, Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Baltimore, MD, USA."
39032112,Peri-operative zoledronic acid attenuates peri-prosthetic osteolysis in a rat model of cemented knee replacement.,"Progressive osteolysis can occur at the cement-bone interface of joint replacements and the associated loss of fixation can lead to clinical loosening. We previously developed a rat hemiarthroplasty model that exhibited progressive loss of fixation with the development of cement-bone gaps under the tibial tray that mimicked patterns found in human arthroplasty retrievals. Here we explored the ability of a bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid, ZA) to attenuate cement-bone osteolysis and maintain implant stability. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 59) received a poly(methylmethacrylate) cemented tibial component and were followed for up to 12 weeks. Treatment groups included peri-operative administration of ZA (ZA group), administration of ZA at 6 weeks postop (late ZA group), or vehicle (Veh group). There was a 60% reduction in the rate of cement-bone gap formation for the ZA group (0.15 mm<sup>3</sup>/week) compared to Veh group (0.38 mm<sup>3</sup>/week, p = 0.016). Late ZA prevented further progression of gap formation but did not reverse bone loss to the level achieved in the ZA group. Micromotion from five times body weight toggle loading was positively correlated with cement-bone gap volume (p = 0.009) and negatively correlated with the amount of cement in the metaphysis (p = 0.005). Reduced new bone formation and enduring nonviable bone in the epiphysis for the ZA group were found. This suggests that low bone turnover in the epiphysis may suppress the early catabolic response due to implantation, thereby maintaining better fixation in the epiphysis. This preclinical model presents compelling supporting data documenting improved maintenance of the cement-bone fixation with the use of peri-operative bisphosphonates.","Mann Kenneth A, Miller Mark A, Gandhi Sachin A, Kusler Jace E, Tatusko Megan E, Biggs Amy E, Oest Megan E",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,"Animals, Zoledronic Acid, Osteolysis, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Diphosphonates, Rats, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Imidazoles, Bone Density Conservation Agents, Male, Bone Cements, Disease Models, Animal",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39032112/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Institute for Human Performance, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, USA."
39019004,Bone Cement in Adult Hip and Knee Reconstruction: A Review of Commercially Available Options and Clinical Outcomes.,"Polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement is used extensively in hip and knee arthroplasty. A thorough understanding of the basic chemistry underlying PMMA is important for orthopaedic surgeons because this underscores the specific way bone cement is used during surgery. Recently, clinical research has shed light on the various types of PMMA regarding the viscosity of the mixture and the effect of cement additives. These variations in composition may alter the clinical efficacy of implanted bone cement in hip and knee arthroplasty. Understanding these key differences will allow the surgeon to tailor the PMMA composition as needed to maximize outcomes of hip and knee arthroplasty. This review will summarize the preclinical feature of PMMA, evaluate current and past commercially available bone cement options, analyze preclinical results and clinical outcomes of various bone cement types, and highlight future areas of research.","Auran Richard, Movassaghi Kamran, Nam Denis, Heckmann Nathanael",The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,"Humans, Bone Cements, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip, Treatment Outcome, Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39019004/,"From the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Oregon Clinic Orthopedics, Portland, OR (Auran), the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Keck School of Medicine of USC, Los Angeles, CA (Movassaghi and Heckmann), and the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL (Nam)."
39011084,Cementless TKA use as an alternative to cemented TKA in high BMI patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Obesity is prevalent, with nearly one-third of the world's population being classified as obese. In patients with high body mass index (BMI)/body mass undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA), there is an increase in strain placed on the implant fixation interfaces. As such, component fixation is a potential concern when performing TKA in the obese patient. To address the growing concerns around the longevity of implant fixation, some have advocated cementless over cemented fixation. However, there is no clear consensus on whether a cementless fixation has more favourable outcomes. The aim of this paper was to present a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing evidence to establish if cementless TKA has a lower rate of aseptic loosening in high BMI patients when compared to cemented TKA procedures. A systematic review was performed, and the following databases Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (1946 to date), PubMed (1966 to date) and Excerpta Medica Database (1974 to date) were searched. All studies comparing cementless to cemented TKA in patients with BMI > 30 were considered. Meta-analysis compared aseptic loosening and all-cause revision between cemented and uncemented implant use in BMI > 30 patients. The search returned 91 articles in total; after duplicates were removed, the yield was 44 studies. Of the remaining studies that were assessed, three studies met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio for all-cause revisions was 0.17 (95%, 0.08-0.36) in favour of uncemented implants (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The pooled odds ratio for aseptic loosening was 0.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.90) in favour of uncemented implants (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Meta-analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in all-cause revisions and revisions for aseptic loosening when using uncemented fixation in high BMI patients when compared to the use of cemented implants. The level of evidence is 1 for our systematic review.","Le Giang Truong, van Duren Bernard Hendrick, Ilo Kevin, Berber Reshid, Matar Hosam E, Bloch Benjamin V",Journal of experimental orthopaedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39011084/,Nottingham Elective Orthopaedic Services Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust Nottingham UK.; Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine University of Leeds Leeds UK.
38987503,Reconstruction of mechanical leg axis using non-modular cemented hinged prosthesis in complex primary total knee arthroplasty.,"Modular cementless knee arthroplasty systems are capable of precise reconstruction of the mechanical axis. However, they are considered more susceptible to complications. In contrast, non-modular cemented systems are said to be more forgiving and show good long-term results. The aim of this study was to investigate the resulting leg axis after implantation of a non-modular cemented rotating hinged knee prosthesis. Furthermore, potential risk factors for the occurrence of malalignment and complications should be identified. Between 2005 and 2015, 115 patients could be included in this monocentric retrospective cohort study. All patients underwent primary hinged non-modular cemented total knee arthroplasty. Preoperative and postoperative standardized long radiographs were analysed to determine resulting leg axis. Furthermore, epidemiological and intraoperative data as well as perioperative complications were surveyed. Average leg axis was 5.8° varus preoperatively and 0.6° valgus postoperatively. Considering an axis deviation of 3° as the target corridor, 27% of all cases examined were outside the desired range. 21% cases showed a femoral deviation from the target corridor and 15% showed a tibial deviation. There was a significant relationship between the preoperative mLDFA and the mechanical alignment of the femoral component (R = 0.396, p < 0.001) as well as between the preoperative mMPTA and the mechanical alignment of the tibial component (R = 0.187, p = 0.045). The mean operative duration was 96 min. No periprosthetic fractures were observed within the study cohort. The main result of the present work is that a non-modular cemented rotating hinged knee arthroplasty system can reconstruct the mechanical leg axis precisely and comparable to modular cementless and unconstrained total knee prostheses. Component malalignment is primarily dependent upon extraarticular deformity preoperatively. Periprosthetic fracture rates and duration of surgery were lower compared with current literature.

A dynamic antibiotic spacer offers an effective solution to preserve patient function and manage infection. However, severe bone loss may compromise the fixation of the dynamic spacer. We describe the application of acetabular screws as rebar in a case of an Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute type 3 defect of the medial tibial plateau. Additionally, we outline a facile method for fabricating the tibial stem component to ensure optimal fit within the intramedullary canal. Short-term follow-up (8 months) indicates successful fixation of the tibial component, absence of knee pain, and a knee range of motion up to 100 degrees.","Mengsteab Paulos Y, Corvi John J, Locke Auston R, Rhee Hannah S, Hayden Brett L",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38983941/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA."
38983796,Biomechanical evaluation of screw and cement placement strategies for treating medial uncontained tibial defects in total knee arthroplasty: A finite element analysis.,"Total knee arthroplasty faces challenges in the management of medial uncontained tibial defects, affecting prosthesis stability and implant survival. The use of screws and bone cement is a preferred approach; however, optimal screw insertion techniques lack consensus in the existing literature. The present study aimed to address this gap by exploring optimal screw and cement placement strategies, focusing on their biomechanical implications. The present study conducted a finite element analysis using a knee prosthesis model with a defined uncontained tibial defect. Various parameters were systematically adjusted, including the number of screws (1, 2 or 3 screws), screw lengths (10, 18, 30 or 40 mm), lateral-medial screw positions (2, 4 or 6 mm laterally) and abduction rotation angles (0, 5, 10 or 15 degrees). These adjustments were made to evaluate their specific and combined impacts on the vertical displacement and abduction angles of the tibial tray. The results revealed that incorporating three-screw reinforcement markedly reduced vertical displacement, while the single screw in the middle position exhibited superior performance in preventing the deformation of abduction angles compared to scenarios with two screws at anterior and posterior positions without a middle screw. Longer screws and smaller abduction angles contributed to decreased movement of the tibial component. Furthermore, the lateral adjustment of the screw position led to an increase in vertical displacement values, reaching ~1.5% when shifted 6 mm laterally. On the whole, the finite element analysis in the present study suggests that, for the treatment of medial uncontained tibial defects, three-screw reinforcement is advantageous for larger defects. Longer screws and a smaller abduction angle are deemed favorable. Moreover, the results underscore the superiority of medial screw placement over lateral placement. It is imperative to note that further clinical validation is essential to corroborate the biomechanical implications observed herein.","Kwanyuang Atichart, Suklim Phachara, Iamthanaporn Khanin, Yuenyongviwat Varah",Medicine international,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38983796/,"Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla 90110, Thailand.; Department of Orthopedics, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla 90110, Thailand."
38983674,Biomechanical study of using patient-specific diaphyseal femoral cone in revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA).,"The primary objective of revision total knee surgery is to achieve solid bone fixation. Generally, this could be accomplished using sleeves and long stems, which require substantial remaining bone stock and may increase the risk of stem tip pain. An alternative approach involves the use of customized diaphyseal cones, which can preserve the integrity of the bone canal. This study evaluates the impact of employing femoral diaphyseal cones with various stem lengths on stress distribution and relative motion. CT scan data from five patients were used to generate the 3D model of the femur, cement, customized stems, and cones, along with assigning patient-specific material for each candidate's femur. Three different stem lengths, both with and without the customized cone, were assessed under three gait loading conditions to compare the resulting Von Mises stress distribution and relative motion. Analysis indicated that the use of customized femoral cones moderately increases stress distribution values up to 30 % while significantly reducing relative motion at the femoral canal-cone interface by nearly 60 %. The presence of the cone did not significantly alter relative motion with varying stem lengths, although stem length variation without a cone substantially affected these values. Incorporating cones alongside stems enhances metaphyseal fixation, reduces stress shielding, potentially allowing for the use of shorter stems. Furthermore, cones promote osseointegration by minimizing relative motion, ultimately improving prosthetic stability.","Nourishirazi Reza, Moradkhani Ghazaleh, SharafatVaziri Arash, Nematy Hamidreza, Shayan-Moghadam Ramin, Karimpour Morad",Journal of orthopaedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38983674/,"School of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.; Center for Orthopedic Trans-Disciplinary Applied Research (COTAR), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."

The cementless UKR was introduced to address this issue. It is unknown how its functional outcomes compare with those of the cemented version on a national scale. We performed a matched comparison of the clinical and functional outcomes of cementless and cemented UKRs. Using the National Joint Registry for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man (NJR), 14,764 Oxford UKRs with linked data regarding patient-reported outcomes were identified. A total of 6,906 UKRs (3,453 cemented and 3,453 cementless) were propensity score matched on the basis of patient, surgical, and implant factors. The 10-year cumulative implant survival rate was 93.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.0% to 95.1%) for cementless UKRs and 91.3% (95% CI, 89.0% to 93.0%) for cemented UKRs. The cementless UKR group had a significantly lower revision risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; p = 0.02). Subgroup analyses showed a stronger effect size (HR, 0.66) among UKRs performed by high-caseload surgeons (i.e., surgeons performing ≥30 UKRs/year). In the overall cohort, the postoperative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) in the cementless group (mean and standard deviation, 39.1 ± 8.7) was significantly higher (p = 0.001) than that in the cemented group (38.5 ± 8.6). The cementless group gained a mean of 17.6 ± 9.3 points in the OKS postoperatively and the cemented group gained 16.5 ± 9.6 points, with a difference of 1.1 points between the groups (p < 0.001). The difference in OKS points gained postoperatively was highest among UKRs performed by high-caseload surgeons, with the cementless group gaining 1.8 points more (p < 0.001) than the cemented group. The cementless UKR demonstrated better 10-year implant survival and postoperative functional outcomes than the cemented UKR. The difference was largest among UKRs performed by high-caseload surgeons, with the cementless fixation group having an HR for revision of 0.66 and an approximately 2-point greater improvement in the OKS compared with the cemented fixation group.

38941476,Tibial Baseplate Migration Is Not Associated with Change in Patient-Reported Outcome Measures and Clinical Scores After TKA: A Secondary Analysis of 5 Radiostereometric Analysis Studies with 10-Year Follow-up.,"Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) provides highly accurate data about the migration of a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) component. However, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) reflect the patients' perspective of their functional status, pain, and overall health after TKA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between tibial implant migration and change in postoperative PROMs and clinical scores, using data pooled from long-term follow-up RSA studies. Individual implant migration data were collected from 5 randomized RSA studies, including a total of 300 patients with 6 distinct TKA implant designs (all Stryker). Tibial implant migration (maximum total point motion [MTPM]) was evaluated with RSA at 3 months, 1 year, and 2, 5, 7, and 10 years postoperatively. The Knee Society Score (KSS)-Knee and KSS-Function and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales were collected in all studies at the same follow-up times. Linear mixed-effects models, with adjustment for TKA implant design and patient characteristics, were used to analyze the data. The 3-month follow-up visit was used as the baseline to assess the association between implant migration and PROMs across the 10-year follow-up. No association between tibial implant migration and change in KSS-Knee (p = 0.384), KSS-Function (p = 0.737), KOOS-Symptoms (p = 0.398), KOOS-Pain (p = 0.699), KOOS-Activities of Daily Living (p = 0.205), KOOS-Sport and Recreation (p = 0.702), or KOOS-Quality of Life (p = 0.368) was found across the entire follow-up. Similar results were found when using the 2-year follow-up as the baseline, after which both cemented and uncemented implants are expected to have stabilized. Tibial baseplate migration was not associated with postoperative worsening in PROMs or clinical scores in patients who underwent TKA. These findings suggest that implant migration, as measured with RSA, measures a different parameter (i.e., implant-bone fixation) than PROMs (i.e., patient perception) and clinical scores. Therefore, to assess the performance and safety of TKA implant designs, RSA and PROMs cannot be used interchangeably during the postoperative follow-up of patients and evaluation of the fixation of knee implants.

38911186,Third-generation posterior-stabilised cemented system for total knee arthroplasty: Survivorship and outcomes after 20-year follow-up.,"Total knee arthroplasty is a common procedure due to increased life expectancy and ageing populations, necessitating implants with long-term efficacy. After some initial designs, the third-generation modular posterior-stabilised NexGen® prosthesis aimed to enhance kinematics and reduce complications. This study evaluates the long-term outcomes, survivorship, revision rates and complications of this implant. With promising results observed up to 15 years in previous studies, this investigation aims to assess the implant's performance over extended follow-up periods, aiding in optimal implant selection for improved patient outcomes. We carried out a retrospective study on 263 total knee arthroplasties performed in our centre between 1998 and 2002. Statistical analysis of complications was performed and study of survival using the Kaplan-Meier method and competing risk analysis were calculated. Description of reinterventions and complications were also included. Results show a 20-year prosthesis survival rate of 90.8% for revision due to any reason, with an estimated survival of 92.3% considering competitive events. Estimated survivorship at 20 years is 98% for aseptic loosening as the end point, and an estimation of 98.80% considering competitive events. Twenty revisions were performed, with 10 cases due to infection and 10 for noninfectious reasons and three of them due to aseptic loosening. Radiographic analysis revealed radiolucent lines, but no clinical evidence of loosening was observed in these cases. This study offers survivorship data from longer follow-up periods, what is difficult to find in the reported literature and showed excellent results of this implant in terms of survivorship and low rates of revision in our cohort.

38909590,High-dose vancomycin spacers provided early recovery without nephrotoxicity compared with standard-dose in MRSA-induced periprosthetic joint infection model of rats.,"Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are commonly treated with two-stage revision surgery utilising antibiotic-loaded spacers; however, antibiotic release from spacers is limited and usually drops below effective levels a few days after placement. This study compared high-dose and standard-dose vancomycin-loaded spacers in terms of efficacy, safety, and overall treatment duration in a rat periprosthetic joint infection model. Thirty male Wistar albino rats (8-10 weeks old, 300-320 g) were housed individually at standard conditions. A periprosthetic infection model was established in the right knee of the rats using methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) -contaminated Kirschner wires. Two weeks later, the infection was verified, and the Kirschner wires were removed. Rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 10): standard-dose (SVanc) and high-dose (HVanc) vancomycin groups had 2.5 and 7.5% vancomycin in their spacers, respectively, while the control group had no spacers. All groups received intramuscular (IM) vancomycin and gentamicin for 4 weeks after spacer implantation. Microbiological counts and vancomycin levels in the blood and joint flush samples were measured, and histopathological assessments were conducted on the femur and kidneys. After spacer implantation, MRSA was eliminated in the HVanc group with 4 weeks of treatment, while the SVanc group required 6 weeks of treatment (P < 0.001). Histopathological findings of the femoral medulla and cortical samples were better in the HVanc group compared with other groups (P = 0.007). Vancomycin levels in serum remained within safe limits in all groups, and kidney damage was not observed. The use of high-dose vancomycin spacers might accelerate the transition period, which in turn reduces the duration of systemic antibiotic use and mitigates the risk of nephrotoxicity. Thus, this method may decrease the medical costs associated with PJI treatment.","Ersoy Ahmet, Say Ferhat, Tokur Orhan, Karaca Efe, Aksoy Abdurrahman, Çiftçi Alper",The Knee,"Animals, Vancomycin, Prosthesis-Related Infections, Male, Rats, Rats, Wistar, Staphylococcal Infections, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Disease Models, Animal, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Knee Prosthesis",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38909590/,"Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Faculty of Medicine, Ondokuz Mayıs University, Türkiye.

This was done to investigate the stress shielding effect, stability of the tibia plate, and the biomechanical effects in TKA models with various medial defects and different stem length models.The results demonstrated that in the bone defect model, the longer the stem, the lower the average von Mises stress on the cortical and trabecular bones. In particular, as the bone defect increased, the average von Mises stress on cortical and trabecular bones increased. The average increase in stress according to the size of the bone defect was smaller in the long stem than in the short stem. The maximal principal strain on the trabecular bone occurred mainly at the contact point on the distal end of the stem of the tibial implant. When a short stem was applied, the maximal principal strain on the trabecular bone was approximately 8% and 20% smaller than when a long stem was applied or when no stem was applied, respectively.The findings suggest that a short stem extension of the tibial component could help achieve excellent biomechanical results when performing TKA with a medial tibial bone defect.","Kwon Hyuck Min, Hong Hyoung-Taek, Kim Inuk, Cho Byung Woo, Koh Yong-Gon, Park Kwan Kyu, Kang Kyoung-Tak",The journal of knee surgery,"Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Finite Element Analysis, Humans, Tibia, Biomechanical Phenomena, Knee Prosthesis, Stress, Mechanical, Prosthesis Design",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38870990/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Joint Reconstruction Center, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Yonsei Sarang Hospital, 10 Hyoryeong-ro, Seocho-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea."
38835466,Combined Medial Collateral Ligament Reconstruction and Polyethylene Exchange for Valgus Instability Following Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Valgus instability can occur after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) due to traumatic medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury, component malpositioning, or progressive ligamentous laxity. Although revision TKA with exchange of the polyethylene to a varus-valgus-constrained liner can reduce laxity due to MCL insufficiency, isolated liner exchange in the setting of collateral ligament insufficiency may lead to greater strain at the cement-bone or implant-cement interface and possibly a greater rate of aseptic loosening. Anatomic MCL reconstruction can be performed in conjunction with liner exchange to restore stability and reduce strain compared with liner exchange alone. The purpose of this Technical Note is to describe a technique for MCL reconstruction and liner exchange for treatment of valgus instability after TKA.","Kanakamedala Ajay C, Lin Charles C, Whalen Ryan J, Hackett Thomas R, Provencher Matthew T, Vidal Armando F, Rozell Joshua C, Kim Raymond H",Arthroscopy techniques,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38835466/,"Steadman Clinic & Steadman Philippon Research Institute, Vail, Colorado, U.S.A.; NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital, New York, New York, U.S.A."
38833774,A unique case report of a revision extensor mechanism reconstruction using Marlex mesh in the setting of proximal tibial bone deficiency: The tantalum clamshell technique.,"Extensor mechanism (EM) disruption is a rare but severe complication of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that can greatly impair function. Treatment options for chronic patella tendon ruptures include primary repair, autograft augmentation, and reconstruction with allograft or synthetic material. Despite various techniques, failures can occur, and options for reconstruction after a failed allograft or mesh are limited, especially if the tibial component is well-fixed and cannot be easily removed, and if there is proximal tibial deficiency from a previous failed EM allograft. This case report presents a novel solution for revision EM reconstruction in a 72y.o. female patient with a history of multiple EM failures using an off-label Trabecular Metal Cone-Mesh-Cone (TM CMC) clamshell construct. The surgical procedure involved the removal of a non-viable allograft from the knee joint and the creation of a custom trabecular metal (TM) clamshell construct with a Marlex mesh graft in between the two TM implants. The customized TM cone was designed to cover the deficient anterior tibia and wrap around the ingrown TM cone. The Marlex mesh was cemented between the existing implant and the customized TM cone, and the construct was secured in place with two cancellous screws. The mesh was tunneled between soft tissue to prevent contact with the implant and rotated scar tissue was interposed to prevent abrasion of the mesh on the implant surfaces. The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were noted postoperatively. At a follow-up 12 months after the operation the patient remains satisfied with the result.","Flevas Dimitrios A, Liow Ming Han Lincoln, Braun Sebastian, Chalmers Brian P, Cushner Fred D, Sculco Peter K",The Knee,"Humans, Female, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Tibia, Surgical Mesh, Reoperation, Aged, Tantalum, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Failure, Tendon Injuries, Plastic Surgery Procedures",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38833774/,"Stavros Niarchos Foundation Complex Joint Reconstruction Center, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.; Stavros Niarchos Foundation Complex Joint Reconstruction Center, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA; Goethe University, Department of Orthopedics (Friedrichsheim), University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.; Stavros Niarchos Foundation Complex Joint Reconstruction Center, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA; Adult Reconstruction and Joint Replacement, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.; Adult Reconstruction and Joint Replacement, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.; Stavros Niarchos Foundation Complex Joint Reconstruction Center, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA; Adult Reconstruction and Joint Replacement, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA.

38825183,Relationship between cement penetration and incidence of a radiolucent line around the tibia 2 years after total knee arthroplasty: A retrospective study.,"Cement penetration (CP) plays a key role in implant stability for cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and the radiolucent line (RLL) >2 ​mm is a preliminary sign for loosening of components. However, the direct relationship between CP and the frequency of RLL >2 ​mm is unclear, and the best cut-off value for CP to prevent RLL >2 ​mm also remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate this relationship between CP and RLL and to determine the clinical cut-off value for tibial CP in patients 2 years after TKA. This retrospective study investigated 157 knees from 123 patients with osteoarthritis who underwent cemented TKA. The CP and RLL immediately after TKA and the RLL 2 years after TKA were measured for the medial, lateral, anterior, and posterior tibial baseplate zones. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the best cut-off values for CP. RLL >2 ​mm was not observed just after TKA. An RLL >2 ​mm was observed in any tibial baseplate zone in 22 knees from 20 patients (RLL+ group) and was not observed in the remaining (RLL- group) 2 years after TKA. The mean CP for all zones was significantly higher in the RLL- group (2.5 ​± ​1.1 ​mm) than in the RLL+ group (1.7 ​± ​0.6 ​mm; P ​< ​0.001). An RLL >2 ​mm was seen in 21 knees in the medial zone, 9 knees in the lateral zone, 8 knees in the anterior zone, and 3 knees in the posterior zone. CP values with RLL >2 ​mm were significantly lower than those without the RLL at the medial, anterior, and posterior tibial baseplate zones. The best cut-off values from the ROC curve of CP in each zone were between 1.1 ​mm and 2.1 ​mm. The depth of the CP directly affects the incidence of an RLL >2 ​mm. The best cut-off value for tibial CP to prevent an RLL >2 ​mm is 2.1 ​mm.","Sasaki Ryo, Nagashima Masaki, Tanaka Kentaro, Takeshima Kenichiro",Journal of ISAKOS : joint disorders & orthopaedic sports medicine,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Retrospective Studies, Male, Female, Tibia, Aged, Bone Cements, Middle Aged, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Incidence, Prosthesis Failure, ROC Curve, Radiography, Knee Prosthesis, Aged, 80 and over, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38825183/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, International University of Health and Welfare Mita Hospital, 1-4-3 Mita, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8329, Japan; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, School of Medicine, International University of Health and Welfare, 852, Hatakeda, Narita City, Chiba 286-8520, Japan; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, NHO Tokyo Medical Center, 2-5-1 Higashigaoka, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 152-8902, Japan.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, International University of Health and Welfare Mita Hospital, 1-4-3 Mita, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8329, Japan; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, School of Medicine, International University of Health and Welfare, 852, Hatakeda, Narita City, Chiba 286-8520, Japan.

38819292,Survivorship and complications of cementless compared to cemented posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasties: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Controversy exists on the best fixation for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Non-cemented fixation has been theorized to improve patient outcomes and longevity of implantation but no study has focused on comparison between cemented or cementless posterior-stabilized implants despite being the most commonly or second most frequently utilized implant in most total knee replacement registries. Inclusion criteria with observational and interventional papers, and review articles that focused on patients with cementless and cemented PS TKAs were used to analyze outcomes such as implant survivorship, complication, or revision rates. Using a combination of keywords, a systematic search was performed on Medline (PubMed), Embase, and Cochrane Library for Meta-Analysis. When using the specified criteria, only 8 studies were selected for full-text analysis and meta-analysis after eliminating screening duplicates, titles, and abstracts without full-text access. These eight studies contain 1652 patients, 693 in the non-cemented Group, and 959 in the cemented total knee prosthesis Group. The meta-analysis revealed the advantage of cementless fixation over cemented fixation in implant survivorship, with 0.6% and 2.6% of aseptic loosening in each Group. The cumulative survival at 12 years was 97.4% for the cementless Group and 89.2% for the cemented Group. The subgroup with a stem showed a positive outcome for cementless fixation over cemented fixation regarding implant survivorship. No differences between the cemented and cementless TKAs were observed in patient-reported outcomes, revision rates, or radiolucent line development. We observed comparable rates for cemented and cementless posterior-stabilized TKAs over a medium-term follow-up period.","Chahidi Esfandiar, Martinov Sagi, Simion Filip, Mercier Camille, Sabot Liam, Kyriakydis Theofylaktos, Callewier Antoine, Hernigou Jacques",SICOT-J,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38819292/,"Université Libre de Bruxelles, Av.

38817414,"Re-revision Total Knee Arthroplasty: Causes, Risk Factors and Results.","The rate of re-revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) ranges between 4% and 10%, depending on the cause of the procedure. Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) and periprosthetic fracture are the main causes of re-revision TKA. The likelihood of implant survival of re-revision TKA diminishes with each subsequent revision, with PJI being the main cause of multiple revisions. Acute early aseptic revision TKA (within 90 days of surgery) involves a high risk of re-revision at 2 years and a high risk of subsequent PJI. The use of antibiotic-loaded cement is associated with lower risk of re-revision. Patients younger than 50 years experiencing aseptic revision TKA have a 1 in 3 risk of re-revision. Patients revised for instability or having prior TKA revisions have the highest risk of re-revision at 10 years.

38798096,"Lessons From Revision Total Ankle Replacement: Tibias Fail Earlier, and Taluses Fail Later (and Fail Again).","The literature on survivorship and outcomes after revision total ankle replacement (TAR) in the modern era is limited. This study aimed to describe the timing to revision and survivorship after revision TAR. We hypothesized that tibial-sided failures would occur earlier after the primary TAR, and secondary revisions after failure of revision TAR would occur more due to talar-sided failures than tibial-sided failures. This is a single-institution retrospective study of TAR patients with minimum 2-year follow-up. Revision TARs (defined as exchange of tibial and/or talar components) for aseptic causes with any implant were included. Etiology of failure necessitating revision and ultimate outcomes after revision (survival of TAR revision, additional revision, conversion to fusion, and below-knee amputation [BKA]) were recorded. There were 46 revision TARs, with mean age of 60.6 (range: 31-77) years and mean 3.5 years' follow-up postrevision. Revisions for tibial failure occurred significantly earlier (n = 22, 1.3 ± 0.5 years after index procedure) than those for talar failure (n = 19, 2.3 ± 1.7 years after index procedure) or combined tibial-talar failure (n = 5, 3.4 ± 3.4 years after index procedure) (<i>P</i> = .015). Revisions for tibial-only failure had better survival (95.5%) than revisions for talar or combined tibial-talar failures: 26% of talar failures and 20% of combined tibial-talar failures underwent ≥1 revisions. Of the 6 additional revisions after failure of the talar component, 1 ultimately underwent BKA, 2 were converted to total talus replacement, 2 were revised to modular augmented talar components, and 1 was treated with explant and cement spacer for PJI after the revision. TAR tibial failures occurred earlier than talar failures or combined tibial-talar failures. Revisions for talar failures and combined tibial-talar failures were more likely to require additional revision or ultimately fail revision treatment. This is important given the consequences of talar implant subsidence, bone necrosis, loss of bone stock, and limited salvage options.","Henry Jensen K, Teehan Emily, Deland Jonathan, Ellis Scott J, Demetracopoulos Constantine",Foot & ankle international,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Ankle, Reoperation, Retrospective Studies, Prosthesis Failure, Middle Aged, Aged, Tibia, Talus, Male, Female, Adult, Time Factors, Ankle Joint, Joint Prosthesis",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38798096/,"Foot & Ankle Department, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY, USA."
38788785,Selective Use of Modern Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty is Not Associated with Increased Risk of Revision in Patients Aged 65 or Greater: An Analysis from the American Joint Replacement Registry.,"Modern highly porous surfaces have increased confidence and use of cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the United States. As cementless TKA use increases, there remains a paucity of literature regarding associated risk of revision in patients aged ≥65 years. We analyzed the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) data from January 2012 to March 2020 identifying patients aged ≥65 years undergoing primary TKA with linked cases to supplemental centers for Medicare and Medicaid data. Patients with hybrid fixation, reverse hybrid fixation, missing component data, highly constrained implants, and stem extension/augmentation were excluded. We identified 442,745 cemented TKAs and 19,841 modern cementless TKAs with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Cumulative incident function (CIF) curves and cause-specific Cox models evaluated the risk of all-cause revision and revision for mechanical loosening, adjusting for body mass index (BMI), sex, age, cruciate retaining (CR) versus posterior stabilized (PS) femoral design, patellar resurfacing, and Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI). Patients with cementless compared with cemented TKA were younger (mean age: 71.9 vs. 73.2 years, <i>p</i> < 0.001), more likely to be male sex (48.8 vs. 39.0%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), more likely to have a CR femoral design (81.1 vs. 45.7%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), less likely to have patellar resurfacing (92.7 vs. 95.0%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and had a lower CCI (mean: 2.9 vs. 3.1, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) showed no difference in associated risk for all-cause revision (HR: 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-1.24; <i>p</i> = 0.382) or revision for mechanical loosening (HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 0.9-2.12; <i>p</i> = 0.14) for cementless versus cemented TKA. Our results suggest that current selective use of cementless fixation for TKA in patients aged ≥65 years in the United States is not associated with an increased risk of revision. While encouraging, further study is necessary to establish indications for use in this age group prior to broader adoption in this patient population.

38784946,Total knee arthroplasty: Quality assurance and improved longevity costs less.,"There is an accepted variation in the financial cost of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implants but it is not known whether this cost is reflected by the evidence in support of their use. A cost analysis study was carried out to determine the total cost of consumables of a TKA, and whether this was related to the supporting evidence and survivorship data. Intra-operative data for all unilateral, cemented, primary TKA over a 13 month period at a high-volume Orthopaedic Centre was collected. Level of evidence for each model was taken from the Orthopaedic Data Evaluation Panel (ODEP) website, and data from the UK National Joint Registry was used to assign survivorship (failure rates). Correlation was calculated using the Spearman rank correlation (r). A total of 1301 TKA were performed at the study centre during the data collection period. The mean cost of consumables for a TKA with patella resurfacing (n = 816) was £1969.08 (range of £1061.46 and £5143.89), and without resurfacing (n = 485) was £1846.62 (range of £1118.98 and £4196.81). There was a negative correlation between price of implant and ODEP rating (r = -0.47), with increasing level of evidence being associated with a lower cost. There was a positive correlation between price of implant and rate of implant failure at the1-, 3- and 5-year time-points (r = 0.55, 0.44, 0.28 respectively), with increasing cost being associated with a higher failure rate. Higher financial cost of TKA prostheses was associated with a weaker level of supporting evidence and a higher failure rate. The increased financial cost of new implants may be justified as more data and evidence becomes available to support an advantage in its use over currently established implants.","Afzal Irrum, Getachew Fanuelle, Hu Lisi, Clement Nick, Mitchell Philip, Kader Deiary",Journal of orthopaedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38784946/,"South West London Elective Orthopaedic Centre, Epsom General Hospital, Dorking Road, Epsom, Surrey, KT18 7EG, United Kingdom.; Department of Orthopaedics and Rheumatology, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; University of Kurdistan, Hewler, Erbil, Kurdistan, Iraq."

Subsequent screening throughout the title, abstract and full text was made, followed by complete critical appraisal and data extraction. This sequential process was performed by two reviewers independently and summarised following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines). A quality assessment of the systematic review was performed according to the Quality Appraisal for Cadaveric Studies scale (QUACS), reaching a quality level ranging from 69% to 85%. A total of 10 articles, out of 47, nine biomechanical cadaveric studies and one human clinical study were analysed. A total of 196 UKA tibial components, 74 patellar components, 36 TKA tibial components and 24 UKA femoral components were retrieved, and a high level of heterogeneity resulted overall. The pulsed lavage group showed better cement penetration and higher pull-out force than the syringe lavage group; a higher interface temperature was also found in the pulsed lavage group. No differences were found regarding tension ligament forces between the groups. Our systematic review suggests that pulsed lavage is superior to syringe lavage in terms of the quality of bone-cement-implant interface in knee arthroplasties (TKA/UKA). However, translation of these results from cadaveric studies to individual clinical settings may be hazardous; therefore, clinical in vivo prospective studies are highly needed.

38767223,Comparison of the early postoperative outcomes of cementless and cemented medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.,"The primary objective of this registry-based study was to compare patient-reported outcomes of cementless and cemented medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) during the first postoperative year. The secondary objective was to assess one- and three-year implant survival of both fixation techniques. We analyzed 10,862 cementless and 7,917 cemented UKA cases enrolled in the Dutch Arthroplasty Registry, operated between 2017 and 2021. Pre- to postoperative change in outcomes at six and 12 months' follow-up were compared using mixed model analyses. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models were applied to quantify differences in implant survival. Adjustments were made for patient-specific variables and annual hospital volume. Change from baseline in the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and activity-related pain was comparable between groups. Adjustment for covariates demonstrated a minimally greater decrease in rest-related pain in the cemented group (<i>β</i> = -0.09 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.16 to -0.01)). Cementless fixation was associated with a higher probability of achieving an excellent OKS outcome (> 41 points) (adjusted odds ratio 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.3)). The likelihood of one-year implant survival was greater for cemented implants (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.35 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.71)), with higher revision rates for periprosthetic fractures of cementless implants. During two to three years' follow-up, the likelihood of implant survival was non-significantly greater for cementless UKA (adjusted HR 0.64 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.04)), primarily due to increased revision rates for tibial loosening of cemented implants. Cementless and cemented medial UKA led to comparable improvement in physical function and pain reduction during the initial postoperative year, albeit with a greater likelihood of achieving excellent OKS outcomes after cementless UKA. Anticipated differences in early physical function and pain should not be a decisive factor in the choice of fixation technique. However, surgeons should consider the differences in short- and long-term implant survival when deciding which implant to use.","Bayoumi Tarik, Burger Joost A, van der List Jelle P, Sierevelt Inger N, Spekenbrink-Spooren Anneke, Pearle Andrew D, Kerkhoffs Gino M M J, Zuiderbaan Hendrik A",Bone & joint open,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38767223/,"Hospital for Special Surgery, Sports Medicine Institute, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Amsterdam UMC Location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Charité - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin and Humboldt Universität, Berlin, Germany.; Xpert Clinics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Spaarne Gasthuis Academy, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands.; Dutch National Arthroplasty Registry (LROI), 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands.; Medical Clinic Velsen, Velsen-Noord, The Netherlands."
38759227,The Effect of Cemented Implants Placed During Initial TKA on Surgical Time and Expenses in Revision TKA.,"Revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) is a complex procedure that often requires the removal of previous implants. There is little information evaluating the difference between removing cemented or noncemented knee prostheses in revision surgeries. The purpose of this study was to determine whether removing cemented or noncemented implants would affect surgical time and expenses incurred during revision procedures. This retrospective cohort study used a single-institution database to identify 300 patients who underwent femoral and tibial implant rTKA from 2016 to 2022 because of mechanical complications (infection cases excluded). Radiographs and surgical reports were used to confirm whether the fixation technique was cemented (N = 243) or noncemented (N = 57). The primary outcomes were surgical time and surgery costs. Secondary outcomes included readmission rates, revision implants used, stem usage, and insurance type. The average surgical time was 121 minutes for noncemented and 128 minutes for cemented procedures ( P = 0.118). The 90-day readmission rates for each group were similar at 7.00% for the cemented cohort and 8.77% for the noncemented cohort ( P = 0.643). For patients with Medicare Advantage, the respective surgery costs were $1,966 for noncemented and $1,968 for cemented TKA ( P = 0.988). For patients with commercial insurance, the respective surgery costs were $4,854 for noncemented and $5,660 for cemented TKA ( P = 0.330).

While lateral UKA has many proposed advantages compared to total knee arthroplasty, its technical challenges and relatively small number of cases make this an uncommon procedure. The aim of this study was to report the survivorship and functional outcomes beyond 20 years of follow-up of isolated UKA. Between January 1988 and October 2003, 54 lateral UKAs were performed in a single center. The fitted prosthesis was a fixed plate and cemented polyethylene (PE). All patients had isolated lateral tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, including five open meniscectomies, three arthroscopies, and three open reductions of lateral tibial plateau fractures. Patients with a minimum of 20 years of follow-up were included in the final analysis. Of the 54 UKA, 22 died before reaching the minimum follow-up period and four were lost to follow-up. Twenty-eight were included in the final analysis. Among them, 21 patients remained alive and an additional seven were deceased after 20 years. The mean age at the last follow-up was 84.8 ± 11.9 years with a mean follow-up duration of 22.5 ± 2.1 years. Of the 28 knees, eight underwent revision surgery (5 for the progression of osteoarthritis; 2 for aseptic loosening; 1 for PE wear). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a survival rate at 20 and 25 years of 72.3% (CI 59.1; 88.6). The average time to revision was 14.9 ± 4.9 years.

This study assessed the long-term survivorship, patient-reported satisfaction and pain scores following robotic-arm-assisted lateral UKA for lateral compartment osteoarthritis (OA). A single surgeon's database was reviewed to identify all patients who underwent robotic-arm-assisted lateral UKA with a cemented, fixed-bearing prosthesis prior to May 2015. Patients were contacted to determine implant survivorship, satisfaction and pain. Kaplan-Meier models were applied to analyse survival. A total of 77 knees (70 patients) with a mean follow-up of 10.2 ± 1.5 years (range: 8.1-13.3) were included. Five knees were revised, corresponding to a 10-year survivorship of 96.1% and estimated survival time of 12.7 ± 0.3 years (95% confidence interval: 12.2-13.2) with all-cause revision as the endpoint. Unexplained pain (40.0%) and progression of OA (40.0%) in contralateral compartments were the most reported reasons for revision. Among patients without revision, 94.4% were either satisfied or very satisfied with their lateral UKA and the average pain score was 1.1. Robotic-arm-assisted lateral UKA led to high implant survivorship and patient satisfaction, and low pain scores at long-term follow-up. Progression of OA in contralateral compartments and unexplained pain were the most frequent reasons for revision. These findings support the continued use of robotic-arm-assisted lateral UKA for lateral compartment OA; however, its clinical value over conventional techniques remains to be established in prospective comparative studies.

38733872,Establishing femoral component rotation using a dynamic tensioner does not improve patellar position after total knee replacement with use of anatomic implants: A case-control study.,"Anterior knee pain (AKP) is one of the reasons for dissatisfaction after total knee replacement (TKR). It may result from patellofemoral joint dysfunction, caused by improper rotation of implant components. The aim of this study was to analyze patella positioning in patients after standard measured resection TKR and TKR with a use of a dynamic tensioner, and to assess the frequency of AKP, range of motion (ROM), and patient-reported outcome measures 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively. The study consisted of 127 patients who underwent TKR. Eighty-nine of them treated with use of the dynamic tensioner FUZION formed the study group; the remainder formed the control group. All participants received cemented PERSONA MC without patella resurfacing. All patients had a standard anteroposterior, lateral weight-bearing, long-leg view X-ray and computed tomography examination in 30° of knee flexion following the procedure. There were no significant differences between the study and the control groups regarding: posterior condylar axis (PCA)-patella angle, surgical transepicondylar axis (sTEA)-patella angle, PCA-sTEA angle, deviation from 90° in PCA-patella, sTEA-patella and PCA-sTEA angles. No significant difference was found in a ratio of obtaining PCA-patella angle deviation of more than 3°. Regarding clinical parameters, statistically and questionablly clinically significant difference in favor of the Study Group was found in Forgotten Joint Score 6 weeks and 3 months post-operativley and ROM 6 weeks post-operatively. However, such difference was not found by analyzing ROM 3 months post-operatively, AKP and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores. Compared with the standard 3° of femoral component external rotation, use of a dynamic tensioner does not allow for more accurate restoration of the patellar facet position with reference to the PCA.","Maciąg Bartosz M, Wilk Bartłomiej, Nawrocki Mateusz, Łapiński Marcin, Świercz Maciej, Maciąg Grzegorz, Żarnovsky Krystian, Adamska Olga, Stolarczyk Artur",The Knee,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Male, Female, Case-Control Studies, Range of Motion, Articular, Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Patella, Middle Aged, Rotation, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Femur, Prosthesis Design, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38733872/,"Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, Międzyleski Specialist Hospital, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, Międzyleski Specialist Hospital, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.

To our knowledge, there are no studies reporting the long-term performance of a cemented biconvex all-polyethylene inlay component implanted at the time of primary TKA. The purpose of this study was to examine the 15-year survivorship and long-term clinical outcomes of this biconvex inlay patella used at our institution. We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively collected institutional database and identified 2,530 patients who underwent cemented TKA with a single prosthetic design (from 1996 to 2007) where the patella was resurfaced using this cemented biconvex inlay patella. The mean age at surgery was 68 years (range, 29 to 93). The mean body mass index was 33.0 (range, 16.4 to 76.3), with 61.9% women. At the time of analysis, the mean time from surgery was 20.4 years (range, 15 to 26). We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to calculate survivorship at 15 years. We analyzed clinical outcomes using 3 patient-reported outcome measures collected prospectively. The 15-year survivorship with revision surgery for all causes as the end point was 97.1% (95% confidence interval 96.1 to 98.1%). The 15-year survivorship with revision surgery for a patella-related complication as the end point was 99.7% (95% confidence interval 99.4 to 1.0).

These included non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximeter, and an esophageal temperature probe. The patient then underwent induction of general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA) without significant hemodynamic compromise. Intraoperatively, the patient tolerated the removal of her infected hardware without major complication but upon placement of the methyl methacrylate (MMA), commonly referred to as <i>bone cement</i>, the patient had an acute drop in her end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) and then developed significant bradycardia and hypotension. Despite rapid detection and treatment, the patient continued to collapse hemodynamically and was noted to be pulseless and in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on ECG. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was immediately started per the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) algorithm. Roughly after 45 minutes of continuous CPR and multiple doses of 1 mg epinephrine, it was determined that the patient had suffered a catastrophic and fatal intraoperative event. A team decision was made to stop providing any lifesaving interventions. This patient's presentation is consistent with bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS), an uncommon phenomenon that remains poorly understood. Two leading models for BCIS described in the literature are the monomer-mediated and embolus-mediated models. However, further research into BCIS is warranted to better understand its pathophysiology, incidence, as well as potential prophylactic measures, including the use of cementless arthroplasty. This complicated and fatal case serves as a reminder of the morbidity and mortality associated with BCIS and underscores that anesthesiology teams must remain vigilant and prepared during orthopedic joint procedures.","Sullivan Cameron, Russo Christopher M, Wilson Lorelei, Dennig Sean, Coleman Patrick",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38707158/,"School of Medicine, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, USA.; Anesthesiology, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, USA.; Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, USA."
38704499,Metal-backed or all-poly tibial components: which are better for medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty? A propensity-score-matching retrospective study at the 5-year follow-up.,"This retrospective medium-term follow-up study compares the outcomes of medial fixed-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (mUKA) using a cemented metal-backed (MB) or an all-polyethylene (AP) tibial component. The database of our institution was mined for primary mUKA patients implanted with an MB or an AP tibial component (the MB-UKA and AP-UKA groups, respectively) from 2015 to 2018. We compared patient demographics, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and motion analysis data obtained with the Riablo™ system (CoRehab, Trento, Italy). We conducted propensity-score-matching (PSM) analysis (1:1) using multiple variables. PSM analysis yielded 77 pairs of MB-UKA and AP-UKA patients. At 5 years, the physical component summary (PCS) score was 52.4 ± 8.3 in MB-UKA and 48.2 ± 8.3 in AP-UKA patients (p < 0.001). The Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-12) was 82.9 ± 18.8 in MB-UKAs and 73.4 ± 22.5 in AP-UKAs (p = 0.015). Tibial pain was reported by 7.8% of the MB-UKA and 35.1% of the AP-UKA patients (p < 0.001). Static postural sway was, respectively, 3.9 ± 2.1 cm and 5.4 ± 2.3 (p = 0.0002), and gait symmetry was, respectively, 92.7% ± 3.7 cm and 90.4% ± 5.4 cm (p = 0.006). Patient satisfaction was 9.2 ± 0.8 in the MB-UKA and 8.3 ± 2.0 in the AP-UKA group (p < 0.003). MB-UKA patients experienced significantly better 5-year static sway and gait symmetry outcomes than AP-UKA patients. Although the PROMs of the two groups overlapped, MB-UKA patients had a lower incidence of tibial pain, better FJS-12 and PCS scores, and were more satisfied.","Piovan Gianluca, De Berardinis Luca, Screpis Daniele, Senarighi Marco, Povegliano Lorenzo, Natali Simone, Gigante Antonio Pompilio, Zorzi Claudio",Journal of orthopaedics and traumatology : official journal of the Italian Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology,"Humans, Retrospective Studies, Male, Female, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Propensity Score, Aged, Follow-Up Studies, Prosthesis Design, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Metals, Tibia, Polyethylene, Treatment Outcome, Osteoarthritis, Knee",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38704499/,"Department of Orthopaedics, IRCCS Ospedale Sacro Cuore Don Calabria, Negrar Di Valpolicella, Italy.; Clinical Orthopaedics, Department of Clinical and Molecular Science, School of Medicine, Università Politecnica Delle Marche, Via Tronto, 10/a, 60126, Ancona, AN, Italy. luca8191deberardinis@gmail.com.; Clinical Orthopaedics, Department of Clinical and Molecular Science, School of Medicine, Università Politecnica Delle Marche, Via Tronto, 10/a, 60126, Ancona, AN, Italy."
38690095,Cemented vs Cementless Robotic-Assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty Yield Similar Short-Term Clinical Outcomes.,"In primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), there is ongoing controversy about optimal fixation (cemented vs cementless). Cemented TKA remains the gold standard, with the largest body of long-term evidence available to support it. However, cementless TKA implants are gaining popularity due to potential biomechanical advantages and a growing body of literature supporting survivorship. Due to paucity of literature investigating fixation methods in robotic-assisted TKA (Ra-TKA), we aim to compare clinical outcomes of cementless Ra-TKA with those of cemented Ra-TKA. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent Ra-TKA by 19 surgeons comparing results of cases using cementless vs cemented fixation. We observed short-term complications, emergency room visits, and readmissions. We collected patient-reported outcomes measurement information system and knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome scores preoperatively and 12 weeks after surgery. A total of 582 TKA cases were included: 335 cementless and 247 cemented. The patients in the cementless group were younger and had a higher body mass index. The cemented group had a higher rate of return to the operating room, with manipulation under anesthesia for stiffness being the most common indication in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in 30-day readmissions, 90-day emergency room visits, or patient-reported outcomes. Our retrospective study demonstrated higher return to operating room in the cemented group vs the cementless group. We reported no differences in any other short-term outcomes between the cementless and cemented Ra-TKA. Our data support efficacy and safety of cementless Ra-TKA at 3-month follow-up.","Molho David, Vaidya Swaroopa, O'Sullivan David, Vye Dianne, Nelson Stephen, Bernstein Jenna",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38690095/,"Connecticut Orthopaedic Institute, MidState Medical Center, Hartford Healthcare, Bridgeport, CT, USA.; Connecticut Orthopaedic Institute, St. Vincent's Medical Center, Hartford Healthcare, Bridgeport, CT, USA.; Hartford HealthCare Research Program, Hartford Healthcare, Hartford, CT, USA."

Two-stage revision arthroplasty is the current standard of care for treating PJIs. However, the incidence of spacer retention for prolonged periods is increasing, with little known about its potential complications. We present a case of a 64-year-old female of Southeast Asian descent who had a cement spacer maintained in-situ for 7 years due to poor patient compliance with subsequent follow-up. While patients have satisfactory functional outcomes with the cement spacer, it is not meant for permanent weight bearing. Two-stage revision arthroplasties are only as effective as patients' compliance with subsequent follow-up and surgery. Clinicians must discourage patients from forgoing subsequent follow-up visits and surgery despite satisfactory function and quality of life with the cement spacer in situ to prevent complications related to prolonged retention of cement spacers.","Chan Li Yi Tammy, Yuen Wen Loong Paul, Raghuraman Raghavan",Journal of orthopaedic case reports,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38681934/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Changi General Hospital, Singapore."
38677348,Tibial Slope Is Not Associated With Implant Migration Following Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty With a Single Implant Design.,"The influence of tibial slope on tibial component migration following total knee arthroplasty has not been widely studied, although excessive posterior slope has been implicated in some failures. As implant micromotion measured with radiostereometric analysis can indicate successful fixation, the purpose of this study was to determine the associations between tibial slope, tibial component migration, and inducible displacement. Radiostereometric analyses at 6 visits over 2 years quantified implant migration for 200 cemented total knee arthroplasties. Longitudinal data analysis examined the influence of postoperative tibial slope on implant migration (overall maximum total point motion (MTPM) migration and anterior-posterior tilt migration), accounting for age, sex, and body mass index. The correlations of tibial slope with 1-year migration, continuous migration, and inducible displacements were also examined. Additionally, the amount of change in slope was compared to migration. The mean posterior tibial slope was 8.0° (standard deviation [SD] 3.8°) preoperatively and 3.8° (SD 3.1°) postoperatively, with a mean reduction in slope of 4.2° (SD 4.7°). Postoperative tibial slope (range 14.0° posterior slope to 3.4° anterior slope) was not associated with longitudinal overall migration (P = .671) or anterior-posterior tilt migration (P = .704). There was no association between postoperative tibial slope and migration at 1 year postoperatively (P = .441 for MTPM migration, P = .570 for tilt migration), change in migration from 1 to 2 years (P = .951), or inducible displacement (P = .970 MTPM, P = .730 tilt). The amount of change in tibial slope was also not associated with migration or inducible displacement. Residual and change in postoperative tibial slope were not associated with implant migration into tilt or overall migration, or inducible displacement for a single implant design. These findings support positioning tibial implants in a range of slopes, which may support patient-specific approaches to implant alignment.","Richardson Glen, Kivell Matthew J, Dunbar Michael J, Laende Elise K",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Female, Male, Aged, Tibia, Knee Prosthesis, Middle Aged, Prosthesis Failure, Radiostereometric Analysis, Prosthesis Design, Aged, 80 and over, Knee Joint, Bone Cements, Foreign-Body Migration",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38677348/,"Division of Orthopaedics, Department of Surgery, Dalhousie University and QEII Health Sciences Centre, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.; Division of Orthopaedics, Department of Surgery, Dalhousie University and QEII Health Sciences Centre, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada; Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."
38642850,Femoral Component Debonding Frequently Missed on Advanced Imaging Prior to Revision of a Recalled Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Identification of femoral component debonding in the work-up of painful total knee arthroplasty (TKA) often poses a diagnostic challenge. The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for identifying femoral component loosening with debonding at the time of revision of a primary TKA with a recalled polyethylene insert. Using an institutional database, we identified all cases of revision TKA performed for this specific implant recall following a primary TKA between 2014 and 2022. Patients who had a preoperative radiograph, CT, and MRI were included (n = 77). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) for predicting loosening were compared among the imaging modalities, using the intraoperative evidence of implant loosening as the gold standard. At the time of revision surgery, the femoral component was noted to have aseptic loosening with debonding in 46 of the 77 (60%) of the TKAs. There were no significant differences in demographics in the cohort with femoral debonding compared to those with well-fixed implants. The CT demonstrated a sensitivity of 28% and a specificity of 97%, while the MRI demonstrated a sensitivity of 37% and a specificity of 94% for detecting femoral loosening due to debonding. Both CT and MRI demonstrated poor negative LRs for femoral loosening (LR 0.7). In this series of revision TKAs for a specific recalled component, neither CT nor MRI accurately diagnosed femoral component debonding. For patients who have this implant, it is imperative to interrogate the implant-cement interface intraoperatively and prepare for full revision surgery as well as marked bone loss secondary to osteolysis.","Borsinger Tracy M, Chandi Sonia K, Belay Elshaday S, Chiu Yu-Fen, Gausden Elizabeth B, Sculco Thomas P, Westrich Geoffrey H",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Reoperation, Female, Prosthesis Failure, Male, Aged, Middle Aged, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Knee Prosthesis, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Femur, Retrospective Studies, Sensitivity and Specificity, Aged, 80 and over, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642850/,"Adult Reconstruction and Joint Replacement, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York; Department of Orthoapedic Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia.; Adult Reconstruction and Joint Replacement, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."
38638114,Excellent 10-Year survivorship of robotic-arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.,"Robotic-arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an excellent solution for patients suffering from single-compartment knee arthritis. While outcomes tend to be favorable for UKAs, revision operations, commonly due to component malpositioning and malalignment resulting in accelerated wear, are a major concern. Intraoperative technologies, such as robotic assistance, can help better ensure that implants are positioned based on a patient's specific anatomy and mechanical physiology. However, long-term survivorship and patient-reported satisfaction with robotic-assisted UKAs are limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the 10-year outcomes of patients who underwent robotic-arm-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Specifically, we evaluated: 1) 10-year survivorships; 2) patient satisfaction scores; and 3) re-operations. From a single surgeon and single institution, 185 patients who had a mean age of 65 years (range, 39 to 92) and a mean body mass index of 31.6 (range, 22.4 to 39) at a mean of 10 years follow-up were evaluated (range, 9 to 11). For all patients, the same robotic-assistive device was utilized intraoperatively, and all patients underwent standardized physical therapy and received standardized pain control management. Then 10-year survivorships with Kaplan-Meir curves, patient satisfaction evaluations with a 5-point Likert scale, and re-operations were assessed as primary outcomes. Overall implant survivorship was 99%, with only two patients requiring revision surgery. There was one patient who was converted to a total knee arthroplasty, while the other patient underwent polyethylene exchange at 5 weeks for an acute infection with successful implant retention. Overall, 97% of the patients were satisfied with their postoperative outcomes, with 81% of patients reporting being very satisfied. There were two other patients who required arthroscopic intervention: one to remove a cement loose body, the other to remove adhered scar from the fat pad and the anterior cruciate ligament. This study is one of the first to provide longer-term (mean 10-year) survivorship and patient-reported satisfaction outcomes for robotic-assisted UKA patients. These data show strong support for utilizing this surgical technique, as nearly all patients maintained their original prostheses and reported being satisfied after a mean of 10 years. Therefore, based on these results, we recommend the use of robotic assistance when performing UKAs.","Roche Martin, Vakharia Rushabh M, Law Tsun, Rodriguez Hugo C, Mekkawy Kevin L, Sodhi Nipun, Dubin Jeremy A, Hameed Daniel, Mont Michael A",Journal of orthopaedics,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38638114/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hospital for Special Surgery Florida, West Palm Beach, FL, United States.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, United States.; Holy Cross Hospital, Orthopaedic Research Institute, Ft.

38629751,"Low implantation volume, comorbidities, male sex and implantation of constrained TKA identified as risk factors for septic revision in knee arthroplasty: A register-based study from the German Arthroplasty Registry.","Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a major cause of revision surgery after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA). Patient- and hospital-related risk factors need to be assessed to prevent PJI. This study identifies influential factors and differences in infection rates between different implant types. Data were obtained from the German Arthroplasty Registry. Septic revisions were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates with septic revision surgery as the primary endpoint. Patients with constrained and unconstrained TKA or UKA were analysed using Holm's multiple log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazards ratio. The 300,998 cases of knee arthroplasty analysed included 254,144 (84.4%) unconstrained TKA, 9993 (3.3%) constrained TKA and 36,861 (12.3%) UKA with a maximum follow-up of 7 years. At 1 year, the PJI rate was 0.5% for UKA and 2.8% for TKA, whereas at 7 years, the PJI rate was 4.5% for UKA and 0.9% for TKA (p < 0.0001). The PJI rate significantly increased for constrained TKA compared to unconstrained TKA (p < 0.0001). The PJI rate was 2.0% for constrained TKA and 0.8% for unconstrained TKA at 1 year and 3.1% and 1.4% at 7 years. Implantation of a constrained TKA (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.55), male sex (HR = 1.84), increased Elixhauser score (HR = 1.18-1.56) and implant volume of less than 25 UKA per year (HR = 2.15) were identified as risk factors for revision surgery; an Elixhauser score of 0 (HR = 0.80) was found to be a preventive factor. Reduced implant volume and constrained knee arthroplasty are associated with a higher risk of PJI. Comorbidities (elevated Elixhauser score), male sex and low UKA implant volume have been identified as risk factors for PJI. Patients who meet these criteria require specific measures to prevent infection. Further research is required on the potential impact of prevention and risk factor modification.

38625551,Aseptic midterm survival rates between different cemented tibial stem designs in hinged total knee arthroplasty: a 6-year evaluation from the German Arthroplasty Registry.,"The rate of revision TKA and thus the use of hinged implants (HI) steadily rises. Aseptic loosening lies on the top of the failure patterns. However, no evidence exists until now based on national scale high-caseloads that analyzes the impact of cemented HI stem-design on aseptic survival rates. Data on aseptic HI-revisions with full-cemented tibia-stems were conducted from the German Arthroplasty Registry. Cases were divided in primary HI (PHI) and HI used in revision operations (RHI). Endpoint was a new revision following either a PHI or an RHI. The impact of stem conicity (conical vs. cylindrical), diameter (≤ 13 mm vs. > 13 mm), length (≤ 90 mm vs. > 90 mm) and offset on the 6-Year-Cumulative-Aseptic-Revision-Rate (6Y-CARR) was estimated via Kaplan-Meier curve and compared between groups via Log-Rank-Tests. 3953 PHI and 2032 RHI fulfilled inclusion-criteria. Stem conicity had no impact on 6Y-CARR (p = 0.08 and p = 0.8). Diameter > 13 mm hat an impact on PHI (p = 0.05) with lower 6Y-CARR but not on RHI (p = 0.2). Length > 90 mm showed significantly worst 6Y-CARR in PHI (p = 0.0001) but not in RHI (p = 0.3). Offset-stems showed significantly better 6Y-CARR in PHI (p = 0.04), but not in RHI (p = 0.7). There was no significant impact of the cemented tibia-stem conicity on 6Y-CARR, neither in PHI nor in RHI. The effect of length, diameter and offset on the 6Y-CARR observed in the PHI, was not detectable in the more complex RHI-cases reflecting its limited clinical relevance by itself in more multifactorial backgrounds. Therefore, results must be interpreted with caution due to considerable system-effects and different utilization-scenarios.","Maslaris Alexander, Grimberg Alexander, Melsheimer Oliver, Tsiridis Elefterios, Matziolis Georg",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Registries, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Failure, Prosthesis Design, Germany, Reoperation, Male, Aged, Female, Tibia, Middle Aged, Bone Cements",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38625551/,"Orthopaedic Department at Campus Eisenberg, University Hospital Jena, Klosterlausnitzer Str. 81, 07607, Eisenberg, Germany. alexander_maslaris@hotmail.com.; German Arthroplasty Registry gGmbH (EPRD), EPRD Deutsche Endoprothesenregister gGmbH, Straße des 17.

38607363,Intelligent and Bioactive Osseointegration of the Implanted Piezoelectric Bone Cement with the Host Bone Is Realized by Biomechanical Energy.,"Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement is widely used in orthopedic surgeries, including total hip/knee arthroplasty and vertebral compression fracture treatment. However, loosening due to bone resorption is a common mid-to-late complication. Therefore, developing bioactive bone cement that promotes bone growth and integration is key to reducing aseptic loosening. In this study, we developed a piezoelectric bone cement comprising PMMA and BaTiO<sub>3</sub> with excellent electrobioactivity and further analyzed its ability to promote bone integration. Experiments demonstrate that the PMMA and 15 wt % BaTiO<sub>3</sub> cement generated an open-circuit voltage of 37.109 V under biomimetic mechanical stress, which effectively promoted bone regeneration and interfacial bone integration. In vitro experiments showed that the protein expression levels of ALP and RUNX-2 in the 0.65 Hz and 20 min group increased by 1.74 times and 2.31 times. In vivo experiments confirmed the osteogenic ability of PMMA and 15 wt % BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, with the increment of bone growth in the non-movement and movement groups being 4.67 and 4.64 times, respectively, at the second month after surgery. Additionally, Fluo-4 AM fluorescence staining and protein blotting experiments verified that PMMA and 15 wt % BaTiO<sub>3</sub> electrical stimulation promoted osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by activating calcium-sensitive receptors and increasing calcium ion inflow by 1.41 times when the stimulation reached 30 min. Therefore, piezoelectric bioactive PMMA and 15 wt % BaTiO<sub>3</sub> cement has excellent application value in orthopedic surgery systems where stress transmission is prevalent.","Wang Zhen, Luo Siwei, Yang Long, Wu Zhanyu, Zhang Chike, Teng Jianxiang, Zou Zihao, Ye Chuan",ACS applied materials & interfaces,"Animals, Bone Cements, Osseointegration, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Titanium, Osteogenesis, Biomechanical Phenomena, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Cell Differentiation, Biocompatible Materials, Stress, Mechanical, Barium Compounds",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38607363/,"Department of Orthopaedics, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China.; National-Local Joint Engineering Laboratory of Cell Engineering and Biomedicine, Guiyang 550004, China.; Clinical College of Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117583, Singapore."
38583872,Cementless total knee arthroplasty in young patients using tantalum trabecular implants results in significantly lower rates of aseptic loosening.,"The mean age of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has reduced with time. Younger patients have increased expectations following TKA. Aseptic loosening of the tibial component is the most common cause of failure of TKA in the UK. Interest in cementless TKA has re-emerged due to its encouraging results in the younger patient population. We review a large series of tantalum trabecular metal cementless implants in patients who are at the highest risk of revision surgery. A total of 454 consecutive patients who underwent cementless TKA between August 2004 and December 2021 were reviewed. The mean follow-up was ten years. Plain radiographs were analyzed for radiolucent lines. Patients who underwent revision TKA were recorded, and the cause for revision was determined. Data from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales, Northern Island, the Isle of Man and the States of Guernsey (NJR) were compared with our series. No patients in our series had evidence of radiolucent lines on their latest radiological assessment. Only eight patients out of 454 required revision arthroplasty, and none of these revisions were indicated for aseptic loosening of the tibial baseplate. When compared to data from the NJR annual report, Kaplan-Meier estimates from our series (2.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 5.87)) show a significant reduction in cumulative estimates of revision compared to all cemented (4.82 (95% CI 4.69 to 4.96)) or cementless TKA (5.65 (95% CI 5.23 to 6.10)). Our data (2.94 (95% CI 1.24 to 5.87)) also show lower cumulative revision rates compared to the most popular implant (PFC Sigma Cemented Knee implant fixation, 4.03 (95% CI 3.75 to 4.33)). The prosthesis time revision rate (PTIR) estimates for our series (2.07 (95% CI 0.95 to 3.83)) were lower than those of cemented cases (4.53 (95% CI 4.49 to 4.57)) from NJR. The NexGen trabecular (tantalum) cementless implant has lower revision rates in our series compared to all cemented implants and other types of cementless implants, and its use in younger patients should be encouraged.","Khetan Vatsal, Baxter Ian, Hampton Matthew, Spencer Amy, Anderson Alexander",Bone & joint open,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38583872/,"Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose District Hospital, Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, India.; Trauma and Orthopaedics, The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust Hospital, Rotherham, UK.; Trauma and Orthopaedics, Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, UK.; Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, UK.; Statistical Services Unit, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; Exploristics, Belfast, UK.; University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."
38579049,Efficacy of cementless porous tantalum tibial components versus cemented tibial components in primary total knee arthroplasty: A meta-analysis.,"Total knee arthroplasty involves the use of cemented tibial components for fixation. In recent years, cementless porous tantalum tibial components have been increasingly utilized. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of cementless porous tantalum tibial components with traditional cemented tibial components in terms of postoperative outcomes following total knee arthroplasty. Relevant literature was retrieved from Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using the search terms ""(trabecular metal OR Porous tantalum)"" AND ""knee"" up to July 2023. The weighted mean difference with a 95% confidence interval was used as the effect size measure to evaluate the functional recovery of the knee joint, radiological analysis, complications, and implant revisions between cementless porous tantalum tibial components and traditional cemented tibial components after total knee arthroplasty. Review Manager 5.3 was utilized to conduct a comparative analysis of all included studies. Nine studies with a total of 1117 patients were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of 447 patients in the porous tantalum group and 670 patients in the cemented group. Radiological analysis demonstrated that the porous tantalum group had better outcomes than the cemented group (P < .05). The combined results for the 5-year and 10-year follow-ups, range of motion, Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index, complications, and implant revisions showed no significant differences between the porous tantalum and cemented groups. The results of the 5-year and 10-year follow-ups indicate that the use of cementless porous tantalum tibial components is comparable to traditional cemented tibial components, with no significant advantages observed. However, at the 5-year follow-up, the porous tantalum group demonstrated a good bone density in the proximal tibia. Future studies with a larger sample size, long-term clinical follow-up, and radiological results are needed to verify the differences between the 2 implants.","Li Lei, Pan Chao, Zhang Xingyan, Liu Wei, Zhang Tingting, Liu Yufan, Li Jingyi, Ma Yuhang, Jia Chenfan, Liu Xinying, Shi Chunbao",Medicine,"Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Humans, Tantalum, Knee Prosthesis, Tibia, Bone Cements, Porosity, Prosthesis Design, Treatment Outcome, Reoperation, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38579049/,"Beijing Chunlizhengda Medical Instruments Co., Ltd, Beijing, China."
38568216,Evidence for cemented TKA and THA based on a comparison of international register data.,"Hip and knee implants can either be fixed without cement, press-fit, or with bone cement. Real-world data from arthroplasty registers, as well as studies provide a broad database for the discussion of cemented versus uncemented arthroplasty procedures. What does current evidence from international arthroplasty registries and meta-analyses recommend regarding cemented or cementless fixation of hip and knee implants? A recommendation is generated by means of direct data comparison from the arthroplasty registries of eight countries (USA, Germany, Australia, UK, Sweden, Norway, New Zealand, Netherlands), the comparison of 22 review studies and meta-analyses based on registry data, as well as an evaluation of recommendations of healthcare systems from different nations. For this purpose, reviews and meta-analyses were selected where the results were statistically significant, as were the annual reports of the arthroplasty registries that were current at the time of writing. For knee arthroplasties, long survival time as well as lower risk of revision can be achieved with the support of cemented fixation with antibiotic-loaded bone cement. In patients aged 70 years and older, cemented fixation of hip stem implants significantly reduces risk of intraoperative or postoperative periprosthetic fracture (quadruple). This applies both to elective total hip arthroplasties and to hemiarthroplasty after femoral neck fractures. Antibiotic-loaded bone cement significantly (p = 0.041) reduces the risk of periprosthetic infection, especially in patients with femoral neck fractures. Total knee replacement with antibiotic-loaded bone cement is well established internationally and is evidence-based. Registry data and meta-analyses recommend cemented fixation of the hip stem in older patients. In Germany, USA and Australia these evidence-based recommendations still must be transferred to daily practice.","Humez Martina, Kötter Katharina, Skripitz Ralf, Kühn Klaus-Dieter","Orthopadie (Heidelberg, Germany)","Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Bone Cements, Cementation, Evidence-Based Medicine, Hip Prosthesis, Internationality, Registries, Treatment Outcome, Meta-Analysis as Topic, Review Literature as Topic",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38568216/,"Institute of Hygiene and Environmental Medicine, Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen, Schubertstraße 81, 35392, Giessen, Germany. martina.humez@mikrobio.med.uni-giessen.de.; Heraeus Medical GmbH, Wehrheim, Germany.; Centre for Endoprosthetics, Foot Surgery, Paediatric and General Orthopaedics, Roland-Klinik Bremen, Bremen, Germany.; Department of Orthopaedics and Orthopaedic Surgery, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Germany."
38558190,Outcomes of rotating versus pure hinge knee arthroplasty in the setting of one-stage exchange for periprosthetic joint infection.,"Rotating or pure hinge knee prostheses are often used in case of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Five-year survival data of rotating hinge implants ranging from 52 to 90%, whereas pure hinge data are sparse. This study describes the results of both hinge knee prostheses after one-stage septic exchange. One hundred sixty-seven one-stage septic exchanges of a primary unconstrained total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to a cemented hinge prosthesis (117 rotating and 50 pure hinge TKAs) performed between 2008 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Exclusion criteria were stem extensions or augments used in primary TKA, history of extensor mechanism reconstruction, and a follow-up less than two years after surgery. Rates of reinfection, mechanical failures, and all-cause revision-free survival data were documented. At five years, the all-cause revision-free survival was 77% (95% CI 69 to 82). Thirty-one patients (19%) had further revision for aseptic reasons. In the rotating hinge group, the mechanical failure rate was more than twice as high as in the pure hinge group (13% vs 6%), significantly influenced by higher body weight. At a mean follow-up of 6.7 years, 21 (13%) patients had a reinfection and underwent a further surgery. Reinfection rates did not differ between the two groups. The use of hinge TKA in the revision of PJI shows favourable five year infection-free and all-cause revision-free survival rates of 91% and 77%, respectively. Our study showed poorer results of the rotating hinge design. These results may help surgeons to choose proper implants in case of septic knee revision.","Liechti Emanuel F, Linke Philip, Gehrke Thorsten, Citak Mustafa, Lausmann Christian",International orthopaedics,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Prosthesis-Related Infections, Male, Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Female, Retrospective Studies, Reoperation, Middle Aged, Prosthesis Failure, Aged, 80 and over, Prosthesis Design, Treatment Outcome, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38558190/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Helios ENDO-Klinik Hamburg, Holstenstraße 2, 22767, Hamburg, Germany.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Helios ENDO-Klinik Hamburg, Holstenstraße 2, 22767, Hamburg, Germany. c.s.lausmann@gmail.com."
38555941,Cemented dual-mobility constructs in uncemented revision acetabular components.,"Dislocation remains a leading cause of failure following revision total hip arthroplasty (THA). While dual-mobility (DM) bearings have been shown to mitigate this risk, options are limited when retaining or implanting an uncemented shell without modular DM options. In these circumstances, a monoblock DM cup, designed for cementing, can be cemented into an uncemented acetabular shell. The goal of this study was to describe the implant survival, complications, and radiological outcomes of this construct. We identified 64 patients (65 hips) who had a single-design cemented DM cup cemented into an uncemented acetabular shell during revision THA between 2018 and 2020 at our institution. Cups were cemented into either uncemented cups designed for liner cementing (n = 48; 74%) or retained (n = 17; 26%) acetabular components. Median outer head diameter was 42 mm. Mean age was 69 years (SD 11), mean BMI was 32 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD 8), and 52% (n = 34) were female. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Mean follow-up was two years (SD 0.97). There were nine cemented DM cup revisions: three for periprosthetic joint infection, three for acetabular aseptic loosening from bone, two for dislocation, and one for a broken cup-cage construct. The two-year survivals free of aseptic DM revision and dislocation were both 92%. There were five postoperative dislocations, all in patients with prior dislocation or abductor deficiency. On radiological review, the DM cup remained well-fixed at the cemented interface in all but one case. While dislocation was not eliminated in this series of complex revision THAs, this technique allowed for maximization of femoral head diameter and optimization of effective acetabular component position during cementing. Of note, there was only one failure at the cemented interface.","Wilson Jacob M, Trousdale Robert T, Bedard Nicholas A, Lewallen David G, Berry Daniel J, Abdel Matthew P",The bone & joint journal,"Humans, Female, Aged, Male, Prosthesis Failure, Prosthesis Design, Retrospective Studies, Acetabulum, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip, Hip Prosthesis, Joint Dislocations, Reoperation, Follow-Up Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38555941/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA."
38552644,Cementless versus Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty Using the Same Implant Design: A Mean 5-Year Follow-up Study.,"Cementless implant use continues to increase primarily due to increased numbers of younger and obese patients opting for primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Given the increased use of cementless implants, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the midterm clinical performance of cementless TKA using a highly porous tibial baseplate compared with its cemented counterpart of the same system. We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 400 patients undergoing primary TKA that included 200 patients with cementless components matched for age and body mass index (BMI) to 200 patients with cemented implants of the same implant design with a 5-year follow-up. We evaluated clinical results, complications, revisions, and overall survivorship between the cohorts. Statistical analysis was performed using student <i>t</i>-test and chi-square analysis. There was no statistical difference in age (64.3 vs. 64.3 <i>p</i> = 0.81), BMI (34 vs. 33.1 <i>p</i> = 0.19), preoperative Knee Society Score (KSS) function (41 vs. 32.3 <i>p</i> = 0.22), and preoperative KSS knee score (39.2 vs. 38.3 <i>p</i> = 0.54) between the cementless and cemented cohorts, respectively. The cementless group had seven revisions, while the cemented group had nine revisions (<i>p</i> = 0.609). The cementless group had one revision due to aseptic loosening versus five in the cemented group (<i>p</i> = 0.09). Postoperative 5-year KSS knee scores were 92.84 versus 91.75 (<i>p</i> = 0.386) and function scores were 81.81 versus 69.65 (<i>p</i> = 0.00004) in the cementless and cemented groups, respectively. The cementless group had survivorship of 96.5% for all-cause revision compared with 95.5% in the cemented group at 5-year follow-up (<i>p</i> = 0.60). Cementless TKA using a highly porous tibial baseplate showed excellent midterm results with one case of aseptic loosening at 5-year follow-up and with similar Knee Society outcome scores and survivorship compared with the cemented group. Cementless TKA demonstrated noninferiority to cemented TKA and could be used as an alternative mode of fixation in patients opting for primary TKA.

38548236,"Is Tibial Bone Mineral Density Related to Sex, Age, Preoperative Alignment, or Fixation Method in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty?","Cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has regained interest for its potential for long-term biologic fixation. The density of the bone is related to its ability to resist static and cyclic loading and can affect long-term implant fixation; however, little is known about the density distribution of periarticular bone in TKA patients. Thus, we sought to characterize the bone mineral density (BMD) of the proximal tibia in TKA patients. We included 42 women and 50 men (mean age 63 years, range: 50 to 87; mean body mass index 31.6, range: 20.5 to 49.1) who underwent robotic-assisted TKA and had preoperative computed tomography scans with a BMD calibration phantom. Using the robotic surgical plan, we computed the BMD distribution at 1 mm-spaced cross-sections parallel to the tibial cut from 2 mm above the cut to 10 mm below. The BMD was analyzed with respect to patient sex, age, preoperative alignment, and type of fixation. The BMD decreased from proximal to distal. The greatest changes occurred within ± 2 mm of the tibial cut. Age did not affect BMD for men; however, women between 60 and 70 years had higher BMD than women ≥ 70 years for the total cut (P = .03) and the medial half of the cut (P = .03). Cemented implants were used in 1 86-year-old man and 18 women (seven < 60 years, seven 60 to 70 years, and four ≥ 70 year old). We found only BMD differences between cemented or cementless fixation for women < 60 years. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the preoperative BMD distribution in TKA patients relative to the intraoperative tibial cut. Our results indicate that while sex and age may be useful surrogates of BMD, the clinically relevant thresholds for cementless knees remain unclear, offering an area for future studies.","Borsinger Tracy M, Quevedo Gonzalez Fernando J, Pagan Cale A, Karasavvidis Theofilos, Sculco Peter K, Wright Timothy M, Kahlenberg Cynthia A, Lipman Joseph D, Debbi Eytan M, Vigdorchik Jonathan M, Mayman David J",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Bone Density, Male, Female, Tibia, Aged, Middle Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Age Factors, Sex Factors, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Knee Prosthesis, Knee Joint, Robotic Surgical Procedures",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38548236/,"Adult Reconstruction and Joint Replacement Service, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York.; Department of Biomechanics, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."

Methods This prospective study analyzed 130 arthroplasties in order to determine whether navigation can improve the frontal mechanical axis of the tibia and whether the postoperative angulation of this axis differs from the preoperative one. The mean patient age was 71.8 years, and the mean BMI was 31.17. Eighty-six patients were female. The same cemented TKA model and the same imageless navigation system were used in all cases. Results The mean postoperative tibial angle following implantation was 87.65°, without any statistically significant differences with respect to the previous angulation. However, navigation was seen to result in a nearly neutral tibial axis, a larger number of cases (41.5%-60.8% {p = 0.002}) aligned within the safe zone (90° ± 3°), a smaller number of outliers, and a clustering of values around the mean. Conclusions Navigation improves the frontal positioning of the tibial component in total knee arthroplasties but does not offer any advantages as compared with conventional instrumentation.","Hernandez-Vaquero Daniel, Noriega-Fernández Alfonso, Roncero-González Sergio",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38524042/,"Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, University of Oviedo, Oviedo, ESP.; Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital Universitario San Agustin, Avilés, ESP."

Passive full knee extension during the curing phase is routine to ensure cement pressurization and optimal bonding. This may enable cement extrusion at the lateral femoral interface and result in persistent pain. Therefore, prevention measures should include thorough visualization of the implant after cementing.

38475232,Passive Biotelemetric Detection of Tibial Debonding in Wireless Battery-Free Smart Knee Implants.,"Aseptic loosening is the dominant failure mechanism in contemporary knee replacement surgery, but diagnostic techniques are poorly sensitive to the early stages of loosening and poorly specific in delineating aseptic cases from infections. Smart implants have been proposed as a solution, but incorporating components for sensing, powering, processing, and communication increases device cost, size, and risk; hence, minimising onboard instrumentation is desirable. In this study, two wireless, battery-free smart implants were developed that used passive biotelemetry to measure fixation at the implant-cement interface of the tibial components. The sensing system comprised of a piezoelectric transducer and coil, with the transducer affixed to the superior surface of the tibial trays of both partial (PKR) and total knee replacement (TKR) systems. Fixation was measured via pulse-echo responses elicited via a three-coil inductive link. The instrumented systems could detect loss of fixation when the implants were partially debonded (+7.1% PKA, +32.6% TKA, both <i>p</i> < 0.001) and fully debonded in situ (+6.3% PKA, +32.5% TKA, both <i>p</i> < 0.001). Measurements were robust to variations in positioning of the external reader, soft tissue, and the femoral component. With low cost and small form factor, the smart implant concept could be adopted for clinical use, particularly for generating an understanding of uncertain aseptic loosening mechanisms.","Hall Thomas A G, Cegla Frederic, van Arkel Richard J","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","Humans, Prosthesis Failure, Reoperation, Knee Prosthesis, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Tibia, Knee Joint, Prosthesis Design",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38475232/,"Biomechanics Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK.; Non-Destructive Evaluation Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK."
38458333,"Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Resurgence-Who, When, Where, and How?","Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common procedures in orthopaedics, but there is still debate over the optimal fixation method for long-term durability: cement versus cementless bone ingrowth. Recent improvements in implant materials and technology have offered the possibility of cementless TKA to change clinical practice with durable, stable biological fixation of the implants, improved operative efficiency, and optimal long-term results, particularly in younger and more active patients. This symposium evaluated the history of cementless TKA, the recent resurgence, and appropriate patient selection, as well as the historical and modern-generation outcomes of each implant (tibia, femur, and patella). Additionally, surgical technique pearls to assist in reliable, reproducible outcomes were detailed. Historically, cemented fixation has been the gold standard for TKA. However, cementless fixation is increasing in prevalence in the United States and globally, with equivalent or improved results demonstrated in appropriately selected patients. Cementless TKA provides durable biologic fixation and successful long-term results with improved operating room efficiency. Cementless TKA may be broadly utilized in appropriately selected patients, with intraoperative care taken to perform meticulous bone cuts to promote appropriate bony contact and biologic fixation.","Mosher Zachary A, Bolognesi Michael P, Malkani Arthur L, Meneghini R Michael, Oni Julius K, Fricka Kevin B",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Bone Cements, Knee Joint, Knee Prosthesis, Patient Selection, Prosthesis Design, Treatment Outcome, Congresses as Topic",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38458333/,"Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute (AORI), Alexandria, Virginia; Inova Mount Vernon Hospital Joint Replacement Center, Alexandria, Virginia.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky.; Indiana Joint Replacement Institute, Indianapolis, Indiana; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland."
38451303,Optimizing periprosthetic fracture management and in-hospital outcome: insights from the PIPPAS multicentric study of 1387 cases in Spain.,"The incidence of all periprosthetic fractures (PPF), which require complex surgical treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality, is predicted to increase. The evolving surgical management has created a knowledge gap regarding its impact on immediate outcomes. This study aimed to describe current management strategies for PPF and their repercussions for in-hospital outcomes as well as to evaluate their implications for the community. PIPPAS (Peri-Implant PeriProsthetic Survival Analysis) was a prospective multicentre observational study of 1387 PPF performed during 2021. Descriptive statistics summarized the epidemiology, fracture characteristics, management, and immediate outcomes. A mixed-effects logistic regression model was employed to evaluate potential predictors of in-hospital mortality, complications, discharge status, and weight-bearing restrictions. The study encompassed 32 (2.3%) shoulder, 4 (0.3%) elbow, 751 (54.1%) hip, 590 (42.5%) knee, and 10 (0.7%) ankle PPF. Patients were older (median 84 years, IQR 77-89), frail [median clinical frailty scale (CFS) 5, IQR 3-6], presented at least one comorbidity [median Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) 5, IQR 4-7], were community dwelling (81.8%), and had outdoor ambulation ability (65.6%). Femoral knee PPF were most frequently associated with uncemented femoral components, while femoral hip PPF occurred equally in cemented and uncemented stems. Patients were managed surgically (82%), with co-management (73.9%), through open approaches (85.9%) after almost 4 days (IQR, 51.9-153.6 h), with prosthesis revision performed in 33.8% of femoral hip PPF and 6.5% of femoral knee PPF. For half of the patients, the discharge instructions mandated weight-bearing restrictions. In-hospital mortality rates were 5.2% for all PPF and 6.2% for femoral hip PPF. Frailty, age > 84 years, mild cognitive impairment, CFS > 3, CCI > 3, and non-geriatric involvement were candidate predictors for in-hospital mortality, medical complications, and discharge to a nursing care facility. Management involving revision arthroplasty by experienced surgeons favoured full weight-bearing, while an open surgical approach favoured weight-bearing restrictions. Current arthroplasty fixation check and revision rates deviate from established guidelines, yet full weight-bearing is favoured. A surgical delay of over 100 h and a lack of geriatric co-management were related to in-hospital mortality and medical complications. This study recommends judicious hypoaggressive approaches. Addressing complications and individualizing the surgical strategy can lead to enhanced functional outcomes, alleviating the economic and social burdens upon hospital discharge.

38447565,Two-Stage Treatment Protocol of Fungal Periprosthetic Hip and Knee Joint Infections: the Clinical Experience from a Single Center Experience.,"To evaluate the clinical results and safety of fungal periprosthetic joint Infections (fPJIs) using two-stage treatment protocol. 8 patients with fPJIs (3 hips and 5 knees) using two-stage revision were reviewed retrospectively and followed up at least 2 years. The preoperative demographic data, two-stage treatment protocol, results of microbiology and histologic workup and postoperative follow-up results (reimplantation success rate and infection free time) were recorded. 7 patients got successful reimplantation, with a 75% reimplantation success rate. Two patients got knee arthrodesis eventually. All patients were infection free with a median follow-up of 4.0 ± 2.0 years (range, 2-7 years). Of them, Candida species were found in 7 patients, while non-Candida specimen was only isolated in 1 patient with Aspergillus. Only 2 patients had coexisting bacterial infection (Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Proteus mirabilis respectively). The average interval between the initial surgery and diagnosis of fPJIs was 21.50±34.79 months (range, 4-104 months). The mean time of spacer implantation was 7.75±2.77 months (range, 6-14 months). None serious complication or above knee amputation was found. fPJIs are very rare and considerable challenge after total hip or knee arthroplasty. The goal of therapy is to eradicate local infection and maintain function. Candida species were the most common pathogen. The duration between spacer placement and staged reimplantation was highly variable, and generally dependent upon the results of joint aspirates and infl ammatory markers.

Routine preoperative varus and valgus stress views are crucial for the selection of patients for unicompartmental or total knee arthroplasty. UKA is a soft-tissue based operation that aims to reconstruct the individual joint line and pre-arthritic alignment by restoring the physiological tension of the medial collateral and the cruciate ligaments. Current data for medial UKA show excellent results for both mobile and fixed bearing implant designs with the correct indication and surgical technique. Cementless fixation offers potential advantages over cemented implants. Registry data demonstrate that institutions and surgeons specializing in partial knee replacement (> 30 cases/year per surgeon, > 100/year per institution) with a high percentage of UKA relative to the total number of knee implants (> 20%) have significantly lower revision rates.","Waldstein Wenzel, Aldinger Peter R, Merle Christian","Orthopadie (Heidelberg, Germany)","Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Knee Joint, Reoperation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38441567/,"Orthopädische Klinik Paulinenhilfe, Diakonie-Klinikum Stuttgart, Rosenbergstr. 38, 70176, Stuttgart, Deutschland.; Orthopädische Klinik Paulinenhilfe, Diakonie-Klinikum Stuttgart, Rosenbergstr. 38, 70176, Stuttgart, Deutschland. christian.merle@diak-stuttgart.de."
38420232,Tibial Component Revision Arthroplasty Using Porous Tantalum Cone for Symptomatic Progressive Periprosthetic Proximal Tibial Ganglion Cyst about All-Polyethylene Tibia Primary Total Knee Replacement: A Case Report and Review of Literature.,"Intraosseous ganglion cysts are an uncommon variant found in the subchondral bone. We report here the development of an intraosseous ganglion cyst of the proximal tibia in the setting of a prior left total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with an all-polyethylene tibial component. The cyst was diagnosed on routine follow-up radiographs approximately 4 years status post-TKA. Although initially asymptomatic, 1 year later the patient presented with progressive knee pain and ambulation limitations, so revision TKA was indicated. Computed tomography confirmed an osteolytic lesion suggestive of a penetrating ganglion. Given the absence of malrotation or malalignment of the well-fixed femoral component, the decision was made to proceed with tibial revision to stemmed component cemented through a porous tantalum cone. Postoperatively, the patient had complete resolution of pain and instability with 0-120° of stable range of motion, which has persisted to the latest follow-up at over 6 months post-operative, with radiographic resolution of the cyst. This case demonstrates a ganglion cyst surrounding total knee implants as a possible source of persistent pain following TKA. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a case. This case demonstrates that refractory painful knee implants secondary to tibial ganglion cysts can be treated successfully with revision arthroplasty.","Liu Jonathan, Zhao Leon, Chang Kenny, Laperche Jacob, Smith Nathaniel, Jenkins Derek",Journal of orthopaedic case reports,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38420232/,"Department of Orthopedics, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.; Department of Orthopedics, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.; Department of Orthopedics Frank H Netter School of Medicine Quinnipiac University, North Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Orthopedics, University Orthopedics Inc., East Providence, Rhode Island."
38415874,Microporous titanium and hydroxyapatite improve fixation of the tibial wall in unicompartmental knee replacement.,"Cementless Oxford unicompartmental knee replacement (OUKR) is associated with less pain than cemented OUKR 5 years postoperatively. This may be due to improved fixation at the tibial wall, which transmits tension and reduces stress in the bone below the tibial component. This study compares tibial wall fixation with three different types of fixation: cemented, cementless with hydroxyapatite (HA) and cementless with a microporous titanium coat and HA (HA + MPC). Three consecutive cohorts were identified (n = 221 cemented in 2005-2007, n = 118 HA in 2014-2015, n = 125 HA + MPC in 2016-2017). Analysis was performed on anterior-posterior radiographs aligned on the tibial component taken 1-2 years postoperatively. Aligned radiographs are needed to see narrow radiolucencies adjacent to the wall. Alignment was assessed with rotation ratio (RR = wall width/internal wall height). Perfect RR is 0.3, and a maximum threshold of 0.5 was used. Quality of fixation to the wall was assessed with fixation ratio (FR = bone wall contact height/total wall height). Notable radiographic features at the tibial wall were also recorded. A total of 33 knees with cement, 37 knees with cementless with HA and 57 knees cementless with HA + MPC had adequately aligned radiographs. Fixation was significantly better with HA compared with cement (55% vs. 25%, p = 0.0016). The microporous coat further improved fixation (81% vs. 55%, p < 0.0001). FR > 80% was achieved in 3% of the cemented implants, 32% of HA and 68% of HA + MPC. In cementless cohorts, features suggestive of a layer of bone that had delaminated from the wall were seen in 8 (22%) HA and 3 (5%) HA + MPC knees. Radiographic tibial wall fixation in OUKR is poor with cement. It improves with an HA coating and improves further with an intermediary MPC. Improved tibial wall fixation may explain the lower levels of pain observed with cementless rather than cemented fixation described in the literature, but further clinical correlation is needed.

38415872,High three-dimensional accuracy of component placement and lower limb alignment using a robotic arm-assisted system and gap-balancing instrument in total knee arthroplasty.,"It was hypothesized that robotic arm-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RA-TKA) using additionally a gap-balancing instrumentation will show high accuracy in executing the planning in femoral and tibial component placement throughout the range of knee motion (ROM) during TKA surgery. Prospectively collected data were analysed for patients undergoing RA-TKA. A cruciate retaining cemented design was implanted using the MAKO® robotic system. Lower limb alignment at 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90° of flexion was recorded at the beginning of surgery and finally after implantation of the components. A ligament tensioner was inserted after tibial precut to measure the extension and flexion gap, and final component placement was planned based on 3D CT images. Femoral and tibial component placement was measured in all three planes. A total of 104 patients were included (mean age 69.4 ± 9 years; 44 male, 60 female). The difference in component placement after planning and final implantation showed less valgus of 0.7° ± 1.4° (p < 0.001), less external rotation of 0.6° ± 1.9° (p = 0.001) and less flexion of 0.9° ± 1.8° (p < 0.001) for the femoral component. The tibial component was placed in more varus of 0.2° ± 0.9° (p = 0.056) and more posterior slope of 0.5° ± 0.9° (p < 0.001). The lower limb alignment in extension was 4.4° ± 5.2° of varus of the native knee and changed to 1.2° ± 1.9° of varus after TKA (p < 0.01). Robotic-assisted TKA helps to achieve the target of alignment and component placement very close to the planning.

38357466,Cementing a Monoblock Dual-Mobility Implant into a Fully Porous Cup in Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty to Address Hip Instability: Surgical Technique.,"The use of a cemented monoblock dual-mobility implant into a fully porous cup is indicated for patients with acetabular bone loss who have a high risk of postoperative hip instability. Patients undergoing lumbar fusion for sagittal spinal deformities have an increased risk of hip dislocation (7.1%) and should be assessed on sitting and standing radiographs<sup>1</sup>. Gabor et al. conducted a multicenter, retrospective study assessing the use of a cemented monoblock dual-mobility bearing in a porous acetabular shell in patients with acetabular bone loss and a high risk of hip instability<sup>2</sup>. Of the 38 patients, 1 (2.6%) experienced a postoperative dislocation that was subsequently treated with closed reduction without further dislocation. This surgical technique represents a favorable surgical option for patients with acetabular bone loss who are at risk for hip instability. In the example case described in the present video article, the patients had a history of dislocations, lumbar fusion, and evidence of Paprosky 3B acetabular defect; as such, the decision was made to revise to a porous shell and cement a monoblock dual-mobility implant. With use of the surgeon's preferred approach, the soft tissue is dissected and the hip is aspirated. The hip is dislocated and a subgluteal pocket is made with use of electrocautery to mobilize the trunnion of the femoral stem to aid in acetabular exposure. The femoral component is assessed to ensure appropriate positioning with adequate anteversion. The acetabular component and any acetabular screws are removed. A ""ream to fit"" technique is performed in the acetabulum until bleeding bone is encountered, with minimal reaming performed in healthy bone from the posterior column. A trial prosthesis is placed within the acetabulum to evaluate if there is satisfactory fixation and if any augment is necessary. Care must be taken during reaming to ensure that enough bone is reamed to accommodate a porous shell that can fit the monoblock dual-mobility implant with a 2-mm cement mantle. Smaller porous shells measuring 56 mm are available for smaller defects but are often not utilized in cases of substantial acetabular bone loss. Fresh-frozen cancellous allograft is utilized to fill any contained defects. The revision porous shell with circumferential screw holes is utilized to allow for screw fixation posterosuperior and anterior toward the pubis. The implants are dried prior to placement of the cement. The cement is applied to the shell and the monoblock dual-mobility implant to ensure adequate coverage. Antibiotic-loaded cement can be utilized according to surgeon preference. Excess cement is removed under direct visualization while the cement is drying, and the position of the dual-mobility implant is adjusted in approximately 20° anteversion and 40° inclination. Stability is assessed after the cement cures, and intraoperative radiography can be performed to confirm cup positioning prior to closure. Any remaining capsule is closed, followed by closure of the remaining soft tissue in a layered fashion. A fully porous multi-hole jumbo cup with conventional polyethylene liner and femoral head can be utilized to increase the jump distance of the femoral head. Constrained, lipped, or offset polyethylene liners can be utilized if the shell is well fixed and a dual-mobility implant cannot be inserted. A cemented dual-mobility implant can be utilized in a well-fixed acetabular shell without evidence of loosening or osteolysis. Dual-mobility implants have become increasingly utilized because of their advantages: (1) ability to decrease dislocation rate without increasing constraint and (2) increasing range of motion with reduced impingement risk<sup>2-8</sup>. These implants are particularly useful in the setting of revision cases with large acetabular bone defects. In a study of 76 patients with dual-mobility implants cemented into porous acetabular shells, Muthusamy et al. found that only 3.3% of patients experienced postoperative dislocations<sup>9</sup>. Moreover, acetabular cup survival was excellent, with 100% survival at 1 year and 96.2% at 2 years. The use of a dual-mobility implant is a viable treatment option in cases of revision total hip arthroplasty, particularly those in which postoperative stability is a concern; monoblock dual-mobility implants cemented into porous shells are particularly useful in this setting<sup>2-8</sup>. These trends are similarly seen in patients treated with monoblock dual-mobility implants cemented into porous shells. Muthusamy et al. evaluated the use of this construct to treat instability or risk of hip dislocation in 76 hips, reporting a dislocation rate of 3.3% at 2 years. Additionally, the authors reported rates of all-cause acetabular survival from re-revision of 96.7% at 6 months, 93.3% at 1 year, and 89.7% at 2 years<sup>9</sup>. Physicians should be aware of the possibility for intra-prosthetic dislocations, as although this complication is rare, it has been reported in the literature<sup>7,10</sup>. In order to allow for circumferential coverage for fixation and ingrowth potential in cases with acetabular defects, the shell is typically impacted slightly vertical (45° to 50° of inclination) and in neutral version (0° to 5° of anteversion). Positioning can be adjusted to improve osseous contact and ingrowth as determined by the size and shape of the defect.The use of a drill guide for the locking screws allows limited degrees of variable screw angulation. In the revision setting, longer screws may be placed posterosuperior toward the sciatic notch or anteroinferior into the pubis. Surgeons should be aware of the anatomy and should predrill holes to reduce the risk of injury to surrounding neurovascular structures such as the obturator artery anteriorly.Any screw holes that are not filled should be covered with plastic hole covers in order to prevent cement from migrating behind the cup. Implants should be dried prior to the placement of the cement, and the cement should be applied to the shell and the dual-mobility implant to ensure adequate coverage.Utilize a monoblock dual-mobility implant that is designed for cementation in order to avoid implant dissociation from the acetabular shell.Remove all fibrous tissue that may hinder bony integration.Assess for pelvis discontinuity; pelvis discontinuity and acetabular bone loss are risk factors in the setting of any revision and should be properly assessed preoperatively and intraoperatively and managed accordingly.Avoid over-reaming and damage of the posterior column.Utilize a reamer or trial to assess defect size and need for augments.Place a compression screw where the cup is in contact with the bone in order to avoid tilting.Cover unused screw holes.

38355062,"A Comparison of the Periprosthetic Fracture Rate of Cemented and Cementless Mobile Bearing Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasties: An Analysis of Data From the National Joint Registry for England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Isle of Man.","Periprosthetic fractures are rare but serious complications of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Although cementless UKA has a lower risk of loosening than cemented, there are concerns that tibial fracture risk may be higher given the reliance on interference fit for primary stability. The risk of fracture and the effect of surgical fixation are currently unknown. We compared the periprosthetic fracture rate following cemented and cementless UKA surgery. A total of 14,122 medial mobile-bearing UKAs (7,061 cemented and 7,061 cementless) from the National Joint Registry and Hospital Episodes Statistics database were propensity score-matched. Cumulative fracture rates were calculated and Cox regressions were used to compare fixation groups. The three-month periprosthetic fracture rates were similar (P = .80), being 0.10% in the cemented group and 0.11% in the cementless group. The fracture rates were highest during the first three months postoperatively, but then decreased and remained constant between one and 10 years after surgery. The one-year cumulative fracture rates were 0.2% (confidence interval [CI]: 0.1 to 0.3) for cemented and 0.2% (CI: 0.1 to 0.3) for cementless cases. The 10-year cumulative fracture rates were 0.8% (CI: 0.2 to 1.3) and 0.8% (CI: 0.3 to 1.3), respectively. The hazard ratio during the whole study period was 1.06 (CI: 0.64 to 1.77; P = .79). The periprosthetic fracture rate following mobile bearing UKA surgery is low, being about 1% at 10 years. There were no significant differences in fracture rates between cemented and cementless implants after matching. We surmise that surgeons are aware of the higher theoretical risk of early fracture with cementless components and take care with tibial preparation.

38325192,A novel computational workflow to holistically assess total knee arthroplasty biomechanics identifies subject-specific effects of joint mechanics on implant fixation.,"Computational studies of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) often focus on either joint mechanics (kinematics and forces) or implant fixation mechanics. However, such disconnect between joint and fixation mechanics hinders our understanding of overall TKA biomechanical function by preventing identification of key relationships between these two levels of TKA mechanics. We developed a computational workflow to holistically assess TKA biomechanics by integrating musculoskeletal and finite element (FE) models. For our initial study using the workflow, we investigated how tibiofemoral contact mechanics affected the risk of failure due to debonding at the implant-cement interface using the four available subjects from the Grand Challenge Competitions to Predict In Vivo Knee Loads. We used a musculoskeletal model with a 12 degrees-of-freedom knee joint to simulate the stance phase of gait for each subject. The computed tibiofemoral joint forces at each node in contact were direct inputs to FE simulations of the same subjects. We found that the peak risk of failure did not coincide with the peak joint forces or the extreme tibiofemoral contact positions. Moreover, despite the consistency of joint forces across subjects, we observed important variability in the profile of the risk of failure during gait. Thus, by a combined evaluation of the joint and implant fixation mechanics of TKA, we could identify subject-specific effects of joint kinematics and forces on implant fixation that would otherwise have gone unnoticed. We intend to apply our workflow to evaluate the impact of implant alignment and design on TKA biomechanics.","Glenday Jonathan D, Vigdorchik Jonathan M, Sculco Peter K, Kahlenberg Cynthia A, Mayman David J, Debbi Eytan M, Lipman Joseph D, Wright Timothy M, González Fernando J Quevedo",Journal of biomechanics,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Biomechanical Phenomena, Workflow, Knee Prosthesis, Range of Motion, Articular, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38325192/,"Hospital for Special Surgery, 535 East 71st Street, New York 10021, NY, USA.; Hospital for Special Surgery, 535 East 71st Street, New York 10021, NY, USA.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was performed without any complications, addressing the bony defect with cement and a semi-constrained prosthesis. However, a gouty attack led to prolonged wound discharge and periprosthetic infection postoperatively, prompting revision surgery with debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR). Intraoperative cultures revealed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The treatment included vancomycin and rifampicin.

38298004,Polyethylene bearing wear is comparable for cemented and cementless Oxford unicompartmental knee replacements: Ten-year results of a randomized controlled trial.,"There is concern that using cementless components may increase polyethylene wear of the Oxford unicompartmental knee replacement (OUKR). Therefore, this study aimed to measure bearing wear at 10 years in patients from a randomized trial comparing Phase 3 cemented and cementless OUKRs and to investigate factors that may affect wear. It was hypothesized that there would be no difference in wear rate between cemented and cementless OUKRs. Bearing thickness was determined using radiostereometric analysis at postoperative, 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 5-year and 10-year timepoints. As creep occurs early, wear rate was calculated using linear regression between 6 months and 10 years for 39 knees (20 cemented, 19 cementless). Associations between wear and implant, surgical and patient factors were analysed. The linear wear rate of the Phase 3 OUKR was 0.06 mm/year with no significant difference (p = 0.18) between cemented (0.054 mm/year) and cementless (0.063 mm/year) implants. Age, Oxford Knee Score, component size and bearing thickness had no correlation with wear. A body mass index ≥ 30 was associated with a significantly lower wear rate (p = 0.007) as was having ≥80% femoral component contact area on the bearing (p = 0.003). Bearings positioned ≥1.5 mm from the tibial wall had a significantly higher wear rate (p = 0.002). At 10 years, the Phase 3 OUKR linear wear rate is low and not associated with the fixation method. To minimize the risk of wear-related bearing fracture in the very long-term surgeons should consider using 4 mm bearings in very young active patients and ensure that components are appropriately positioned, which is facilitated by the current instrumentation.

38285554,Four-Year Outcomes of Cementless Versus Cemented Fixation of a Newly Introduced Total Knee Arthroplasty Design.,"Aseptic loosening continues to be a major cause of failure of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Although cemented fixation remains the gold standard, there is renewed interest in cementless fixation as a means of decreasing this risk via biologic fixation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of cemented and cementless versions of a newly introduced TKA design at an average of 4 years postoperatively. This was a retrospective case-control study of 100 primary TKAs comparing cementless vs cemented TKAs using the same cruciate-retaining implant design (ATTUNE Knee System; DePuy Synthes). Fifty patients undergoing cementless TKA with a mean age of 60.8 years (range, 48-71 years) and body mass index (BMI) of 31.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 23.7-41.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were matched to 50 patients undergoing primary cemented TKA with a mean age of 62.7 years (range, 51-73 years) and BMI of 30.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 24.6-43.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The mean follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 4.0-4.4 years) in the cementless group and 7.6 years (range, 7.5-7.7 years) in the cemented group. Complications, clinical outcomes using the Knee Society Score (KSS), and radiographic analyses were evaluated at final follow-up. Student's <i>t</i> tests were used for statistical analyses. There was no statistical difference in age, BMI, and preoperative KSS between the two groups (<i>P</i>=.12, <i>P</i>=.15, and <i>P</i>=.55, respectively). There were no complications or reoperations in either cohort. There were no statistical differences in range of motion and total KSS at final follow-up between the two groups. Final total KSS had a mean of 91.1 for the cementless group and 93.7 for the cemented group. There was no radiographic evidence of component subsidence or loosening in either cohort. When compared with its cemented counterpart, the newly introduced cementless TKA design had similar excellent clinical improvements and radiologic results at an average of 4 years of follow-up.

38282724,Extended Trochanteric Osteotomy in Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"Removal of well-fixed femoral components during revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) can be difficult and time-consuming<sup>1</sup>, leading to numerous complications, such as femoral perforation, bone loss, and fracture. Extended trochanteric osteotomies (ETOs), which provide wide exposure and direct access to the femoral canal under controlled conditions, have become a popular method to circumvent these challenges. ETOs were popularized by Wagner (i.e., the anterior-based osteotomy), and later modified by Paprosky (i.e., the lateral-based osteotomy)<sup>2</sup>. The decision to utilize the laterally based Paprosky ETO versus the anteriorly based Wagner ETO is primarily based on surgeon preference, the location and type of in situ implants, and the osseous anatomy. Typically, a laterally based ETO is most facile in conjunction with a posterior approach and an anteriorly based ETO is most commonly paired with a lateral or anterolateral approach. Attention must be paid to maintaining vascularity to the osteotomy fragment, including minimizing stripping of the vastus lateralis from the osteotomy fragment and maintaining abductor attachments to the osteotomy fragment. When utilizing a laterally based ETO, the posterior border of the vastus lateralis must be carefully elevated to provide exposure for performance of the osteotomy. When an anteriorly based osteotomy is performed, the surgeon may instead extend the abductor tenotomy proximally with use of a longitudinal split of the vastus lateralis distally, which helps to keep the anterior and posterior sleeves of soft tissue in continuity. In either approach, dissection of the vastus lateralis involves managing several large vascular perforators. We prefer performing careful blunt dissection to identify the perforators and prophylactically controlling them, with ligation of large vessels and electrocautery of smaller vessels. Vascular clips are also available in case difficult-to-control bleeding is encountered. In general, an oscillating saw (with preference for a thin blade) is utilized to complete the posterior longitudinal limb of the ETO, extending approximately 12 to 16 cm distally from the tip of the greater trochanter. Although a 12 to 16-cm zone is required to maintain maximum vascularity to the osteotomized fragment, the osteotomy length must ultimately be determined by (1) the length of the femoral component to be removed; (2) the presence of distal bone ingrowth, ongrowth, or cement; and (3) the presence of distal hardware or stemmed knee components. A smaller oscillating saw is then utilized to complete the transverse limb at the previously identified distal extent. A high-speed pencil-tip burr is utilized to complete the corners of the osteotomy in a rounded configuration, and a combination of saws and pencil-tip burrs is utilized to create partial proximal and distal anterior longitudinal limbs of the osteotomy to the extent allowed by the soft-tissue attachments. The anterior longitudinal limb may be further weakened in a controlled fashion with use of serial drill holes. The anterior longitudinal limb then undergoes controlled fracture by placement of 2 to 4 broad straight osteotomes in the posterior longitudinal limb. These osteotomes are carefully levered anteriorly in unison with a gentle, steady force. After the ETO is completed, intramedullary prostheses, hardware, and cement are removed; the acetabulum is addressed as needed; and a final femoral stem is implanted, if appropriate. After completion of the osteotomy, the osteotomized fragment must be retracted gently, with care taken to avoid a fracture and maintain vascularity. To this end, debridement of the endosteum of the osteotomized fragment, including any cement removal, should be avoided until the end of the procedure, when the osteotomy is ready to be closed. Our preferred method for closure is to place 1 prophylactic cable 1 cm distal to the osteotomy, 1 to 2 cables along the diaphyseal segment of the osteotomy, and 1 Luque wire above the less trochanter. A Luque wire is our specific choice for the location above the lesser trochanter because it sits in the effective joint space; however, the use of Luque wires distal to the lesser trochanter is also acceptable. A strut allograft or locking plate can be utilized to reinforce the osteotomy in rare cases or to bridge interprosthetic stress risers. Trochanteric implants are typically avoided because of the low rate of clinically relevant trochanteric migration with this closure technique and because of the high rate of symptomatic implants with trochanteric claws or plates. An alternative osteotomy of similar exposure is the transfemoral osteotomy. Additionally, a variety of non-extended trochanteric osteotomies, such as trochanteric slide osteotomies, offer more limited exposure. Femoral surgical exposure for revision THA can be aided by performing transfemoral osteotomies, but these provide less precise control of the separate proximal femoral osteotomized segment(s), and healing and fixation can be less reliable. Less invasive osteotomies such as non-extended trochanteric osteotomies typically do not provide adequate exposure in challenging cases for which ETO is being considered. ETOs have high union rates, and notable trochanteric migration is infrequent. The most common complications are fracture of the osteotomy fragment intraoperatively or postoperatively. Radiographic and clinical union is achieved in 98% of patients. The mean proximal trochanteric osteotomy fragment migration prior to union is 3 mm. ETO fragment migration of >1 cm occurs in just 7% of hips. Postoperative greater trochanter fractures occur in 9% of hips. The 10-year survivorship free of revision for aseptic femoral loosening, free of femoral or acetabular component removal or revision for any reason, and free of reoperation for any reason is 97%, 91%, and 82%, respectively<sup>3</sup>. Attention should be paid to patient anatomy, deformity, surgical approach, and implant type when choosing to perform a laterally based Paprosky or anteriorly based Wagner ETO.Appropriate length of the posterior longitudinal limb of the ETO is approximately 12 to 16 cm distally from the tip of the greater trochanter.Attention must be paid to maintaining vascularity to the osteotomy fragment, including minimizing stripping of the vastus lateralis from the osteotomy fragment and maintaining abductor attachments to the osteotomy fragment.A high-speed pencil-tip burr should be utilized to complete the corners of the osteotomy in a rounded configuration in order to avoid stress risers.The anterior longitudinal limb is completed by controlled fracture of the remaining intervening segment in order to maintain vastus lateralis attachments and vascular supply to the osteotomy fragment.The ETO is closed with use of cerclage cables and/or double-stranded Luque wires, typically utilizing a total of 3 to 4 in order to obtain secure fixation without compromising local biology.

38274148,Robotic-Arm-Assisted Lateral Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty with a Fixed-Bearing Implant.,"Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with knee arthritis have isolated lateral compartment arthritis; however, lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) comprises just 1% of all knee arthroplasties<sup>1</sup>. This low proportion is partly because of the perceived complexity of lateral UKA and concerns over implant longevity and survivorship compared with total knee arthroplasty (TKA)<sup>2,3</sup>. With an improved understanding of knee kinematics alongside advances in implant design and tools to aid in appropriate restoration of limb alignment, lateral UKA can be an appealing surgical alternative to TKA for certain patients with lateral knee arthritis<sup>4,5</sup>. In appropriately selected patients, lateral UKA has been associated with reduced osseous and soft-tissue resection, more natural knee kinematics, less pain, shorter hospitalization, decreased blood loss and infection rates, and excellent survivorship and patient-reported outcomes<sup>6-9</sup>. This surgical approach and technique described for lateral UKA utilizes robotic-arm assistance and modern fixed-bearing implants<sup>10</sup>. The specific steps involve appropriate patient evaluation and selection, extensive radiographic and computed-tomography-based preoperative templating, a lateral parapatellar approach, intraoperative confirmation of component position and alignment, and robotic-arm assistance to perform osseous resections to achieve limb alignment and kinematic targets<sup>10</sup>. Final implants are cemented in place, and patients typically are discharged home on the day of surgery<sup>10</sup>. Nonoperative treatment for end-stage knee arthritis includes weight loss, activity modification, assistive devices, bracing, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and various injections<sup>11</sup>. Alternative surgical treatments include TKA<sup>4</sup> and, in certain patients, an offloading periarticular osteotomy<sup>12</sup>. Lateral UKA is an appealing surgical option for nonobese patients who have disabling knee pain isolated to the lateral compartment, good preoperative range of motion, and a passively correctable valgus limb deformity<sup>10,13</sup>. Patients are typically discharged home on the day of surgery, or occasionally on postoperative day 1 if medical comorbidities dictate hospital monitoring overnight<sup>10</sup>. Patients return to light activities, including walking, immediately postoperatively. By 3 months postoperatively, patients will generally have returned to all desired activities<sup>9</sup>. The mid-term outcomes of this procedure, as performed by the corresponding author, have been published recently<sup>14,15</sup>. The 5-year survivorship of 171 lateral UKAs was 97.7%, with 72.8% of patients reporting that they were very satisfied with their procedure and 19.8%, that they were satisfied<sup>14</sup>. Only 3.8% of patients reported dissatisfaction with their lateral UKA<sup>14</sup>. The mean Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and standard deviation were 85.6 ± 14.3<sup>14</sup>. These outcomes did not differ from those observed in 802 medial UKAs, which showed a survivorship of 97.8% and KOOS of 84.3 ± 15.9<sup>14</sup>. These findings are generally in line with previously published studies, which have demonstrated excellent survivorship and patient-reported outcomes with fixed-bearing lateral UKA<sup>16-19</sup>.

38261771,My orthopaedic surgeon suggests a unicompartmental knee replacement: a detailed look at the long-term outcomes of a single surgeon's practice.,"This single surgeon case series with up to 29-year follow-up evaluated the survival of the Oxford unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) for isolated medial compartment osteoarthritis. Four hundred and four knees in 330 patients were followed for between 12 days to 29 years, with an average of 13 years. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were calculated using revision for total knee replacement and re-operation for any reason over 5-year intervals. Revision and reoperation rates per 100 component years were used to compare subsets, cemented and uncemented prostheses and Phase 2 and Phase 3 instrumentation. Of 404 UKRs, 292 (72%) were cemented, 96 (24%) uncemented and 16 hybrid (4%); 137 (34%) were undertaken using Phase 2 instrumentation and 267 (66%) Phase 3 instrumentation. Estimated revision-free implant survival at 20 years was 78%, and estimated reoperation-free survival at 20 years was 72%. Unicompartmental knee replacement is a very successful procedure, with 78% of knees remaining revision-free at 20 years. Progression of lateral compartment arthritis was the most common cause for revision, affecting 60% of revision cases. There was no significant difference in the revision or reoperation rate between cemented and uncemented prostheses or Phase 2 and minimally invasive Phase 3 instrumentation.","Lynskey Samuel J, Frampton Christopher M, Lynskey Timothy G",The New Zealand medical journal,"Humans, Orthopedic Surgeons, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, New Zealand, Surgeons, Osteoarthritis",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38261771/,"Orthopaedic Registrar, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Geelong University Hospital, Geelong, Australia; Affiliate Academic, School of Medicine, Faculty of Health, Deakin University, Waurn Ponds, Geelong, Australia.; Statistician, University of Otago Christchurch, Christchurch Central, New Zealand;Statistician, Statistecol Consultants Ltd, Christchurch Central, New Zealand.; Orthopaedic Surgeon, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Taranaki Base Hospital, New Plymouth, New Zealand."
38244641,Survival Rates and Patient-Reported Outcomes Support the Use of Custom Cement-Over Megaprosthesis (CCOM) in Complex Revision Lower Limb Arthroplasty.,"Patients presenting with periprosthetic osteolysis or fracture between ipsilateral hip and knee arthroplasties are challenging to treat successfully. Long-stem implants, osteopenic bones, and patient comorbidities all represent considerable surgical challenges. Poor results of fracture fixation in this group, coupled with the desire to retain well-performing implants and minimize soft-tissue trauma led to the developmentof the custom cement-over megaprostheses (CCOM). The aims of the study were to evaluate implant survivals, complications, and patient outcomes in those undergoing CCOM within our institution. A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing CCOM between 2002 and 2022 was performed. We studied 34 cases, 33 patients, one patient underwent staged bilateral surgery with 26 women and 8 men. trauma (16), failure of implants /aseptic loosening (9), or joint pathology. The mean Charlson comorbidity index was 3.5 (range, 0 to 8). All patients were followed up (mean 75 months [range, 9 to 170]) at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter.

38244639,Zirconium as a Promising Synovial Biomarker for Loose Cemented Knee Prosthesis.,"Aseptic loosening is the most common mode of failure after total knee arthroplasty. Despite this, the diagnosis often remains challenging and mainly relies on imaging modalities. Until today, no biomarker exists to aid in diagnosing loosening of the implants. As zirconium (Zr) is often found in bone cement, where it serves as radiopacifier, this study aimed to establish Zr as a synovial biomarker for loosened cemented knee prostheses. A total of 31 patients scheduled for revision of a cemented knee prostheses were included. In all patients, the initial used cement contained Zr. After arthrotomy, specimens of synovial fluid were taken and levels of Zr were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Depending on the necessary amount of force for explantation, the implants were graded ""loose"" or ""well-fixed"". Preoperative radiographs were evaluated by 2 independent physicians. The concentration of Zr in the synovial fluid differed significantly (P < .001) between the ""loose"" (mean 170.9 μg/L, range 0 to 1941 μg/L) and the ""well-fixed"" (mean 0.6 μg/L, range 0 to 6 μg/L) implants. The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed 0.25 μg/l as an optimal cutoff value leading to a sensitivity of 0.84, a specificity of 0.92, a positive predictive value of 0.94, and a negative predictive value of 0.79. There was no significant difference in the diagnostic performance compared to radiographs (P = .66). Zirconium proved to be a reliable novel synovial biomarker for diagnosing aseptic loosening of knee prothesis fixed with cement containing Zr. This biomarker should not be interpreted in isolation, but in combination with existing diagnostic tools.","Anderson Philip M, Heinz Tizian, Weißenberger Manuel, Winter Philipp, Rudert Maximilian, Jakuscheit Axel",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Zirconium, Knee Prosthesis, Aged, Male, Female, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Biomarkers, Synovial Fluid, Prosthesis Failure, Middle Aged, Bone Cements, Aged, 80 and over, Reoperation, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38244639/,"Department of Orthopedics, Orthopädische Klinik König-Ludwig-Haus, University of Wuerzburg, Würzburg, Germany.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Saarland, Homburg, Germany."
38232933,Early appearance of radiolucent lines around total knee arthroplasty in rheumatoid arthritis patients. How does it impact the aseptic failure rate and functional outcomes at 13 years of follow-up?,"Aseptic total knee arthroplasty (TKA) failure has been associated with radiolucent lines. This study aimed to determine the impact of the early appearance of radiolucent lines (linear images of 1, 2, or > 2mm at the cement-bone interface) around the TKA on prosthetic survival and functional outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients during a 2-20 years follow-up. We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of RA patients treated with TKA between 2000 and 2011. We comparatively analyzed patients with and without radiolucent lines around implants. Clinical outcomes were assessed with the knee society score (KSS) collected before surgery, at years 2, 5, and 10, and at the last postoperative follow-up. The knee society roentgenographic evaluation system was used to analyze the impact of radiolucent lines around the implants at 1, 2, 5, and more than ten years of follow-up. The reoperation and prosthetic survival rates were calculated at the end of the follow-up. The study series included 72 TKAs with a median follow-up of 13.2 years (range: 4.0-21.0), of which 16 (22.2%) had radiolucent lines. We did not observe aseptic failure, and prosthetic survival at the end of the study was 94.4% (n=68). The KSS improved significantly (p<0.001) between preoperative values at 2, 5, and 10 years and the end of follow-up, with no differences between patients with and without radiolucent lines. Our study demonstrates that the early appearance of radiolucent lines around a TKA in RA patients does not significantly impact prosthetic survival or long-term functional outcomes at 13 years of follow-up.","Garabano G, Pesciallo C A, Rodríguez J, Pérez Alamino L, Tillet F, Del Sel H, Lopreite F",Revista espanola de cirugia ortopedica y traumatologia,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38232933/,"Departamento de Traumatología y Ortopedia, Hospital Británico de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Overall, 50 subjects were randomized (21 EF-TKA and 23 Std-TKA in the final analysis), and had follow-up visits at six weeks, and six, 12, and 24 months to assess migration of the tibial component. Low viscosity bone cement with tobramycin was used in a standardized fashion for all subjects. Patient-reported outcome measure data was captured at preoperative and all postoperative visits. The patient cohort mean age was 66 years (SD seven years), 59% were female, and the mean BMI was 32 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD 6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).

38214714,Undersizing of the tibial component in Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) increases the risk of periprosthetic fractures.,"Tibial periprosthetic fractures (TPF) after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) are a rare condition that affects about 1% of cases. Known risk factors include age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and bone density, as well as surgical technique and prosthesis design. The purpose of the study was to determine if undersizing of the tibial component in relation to the femoral component increases the risk of tibial periprosthetic fractures. Over a 6-year-period 1542 patients with cemented (n = 363) and uncemented (n = 1179) medial UKA were retrospectively evaluated. Tibial periprosthetic fractures were identified and classified, and epidemiologic data were documented at follow-up. Undersizing was defined as a smaller tibial component compared to the femoral implant. The association of potential risk factors for TPF with the incidence of TPF was investigated with binominal logistic regression. Fourteen patients (0.9%) suffered from TPF at a median of 1 month after surgery. The mean follow-up period was 5.9 ± 1.7 years. Fractures were more common in cases with undersized tibial components [odds ratio (OR) 3.2, p < 0.05]. Furthermore, older age (OR 1.1, p < 0.05) and female sex (OR 6.5, p < 0.05) were identified as significant risk factors, while BMI (p = 0.8) and cemented implantation (p = 0.2) had no effect on fracture rate. Revision surgery included open reduction and internal fixation or conversion to total knee arthroplasty. Undersizing of implant sizes in UKA increases the risk for TPF especially in patients with small tibial implants. Therefore, mismatched implants should be avoided for UKA particularly when risk factors like obesity, older age, or female gender are present. Tibial periprosthetic fractures were successfully treated by open reduction and internal fixation or conversion to total knee arthroplasty.","Watrinet Julius, Blum Philipp, Maier Michael, Klingbeil Steffen, Regenbogen Stephan, Augat Peter, Schipp Rolf, Reng Wolfgang",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,"Humans, Female, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Periprosthetic Fractures, Knee Prosthesis, Retrospective Studies, Tibia, Tibial Fractures, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Treatment Outcome, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38214714/,"Endogap Joint Replacement Institute, Auenstraße 7, 82467, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. julius.watrinet@klinikum-gap.de.; Department Trauma Surgery, BG Unfallklinik Murnau, Prof. Küntscher Str. 8, 82418, Murnau, Germany. julius.watrinet@klinikum-gap.de.; Endogap Joint Replacement Institute, Auenstraße 7, 82467, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.; Department Trauma Surgery, BG Unfallklinik Murnau, Prof. Küntscher Str. 8, 82418, Murnau, Germany.; Institute Institute for Biomechanics, BG Unfallklinik Murnau, Prof. Küntscher Str. 8, 82418, Murnau, Germany.; Institute for Biomechanics, Paracelsus Medical University, Strubergasse 21, 5020, Salzburg, Austria."
38202240,New Horizons of Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Considering the increasing number of young and active patients needing TKA, orthopedic surgeons are looking for a long-lasting and physiological bond for the prosthetic implant. Multiple advantages have been associated with cementless fixation including higher preservation of the native bone stock, avoidance of cement debris with subsequent potential third-body wear, and the achievement of a natural bond and osseointegration between the implant and the bone that will provide a durable and stable fixation. Innovations in technology and design have helped modern cementless TKA implants to improve dramatically. Better coefficient of friction and reduced Young's modulus mismatch between the implant and host bone have been related to the use of porous metal surfaces. Moreover, biologically active coatings have been used on modern implants such as periapatite and hydroxyapatite. These factors have increased the potential for ingrowth by reducing micromotion and increasing osteoconductive properties. New materials with better biocompatibility, porosity, and roughness have been introduced to increase implant stability. Innovations in technology and design have helped modern cementless TKA implants improve primary stability in both the femur and tibia. This means that short-term follow-up are comparable to cemented. These positive prognostic factors may lead to a future in which cementless fixation may be considered the gold-standard technique in young and active patients.","Polizzotti Giuseppe, Lamberti Alfredo, Mancino Fabio, Baldini Andrea",Journal of clinical medicine,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38202240/,"Istituto Chirurgico Ortopedico Traumatologico (ICOT), Sapienza University of Rome, 00185 Rome, Italy.; Istituto Fiorentino di Cura e Assistenza, 50139 Florence, Italy.; University College London Hospital, London NW1 2BU, UK.; The Princess Grace Hospital, London W1U 5NY, UK."

This study compared coated and standard total knee arthroplasty (TKA) regarding inflammatory response and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). 76 patients without self-reported allergies against implant materials were included in a RCT and received a coated or standard TKA of the same cemented posterior-stabilized knee system. 73 patients completed the 3-year follow-up. Two patients died and there was one revision surgery. Serum levels of cytokines with a possible role in implant allergy were measured in patient`s serum (IL-1beta, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN γ, TNF α) prior to, one and three years after surgery. Furthermore, PROMs including knee function (Oxford Knee Score, Knee Society Score) and health-related quality of life (QoL, EuroQuol questionnaire) were assessed. Additionally, 8 patients with patch-test proven skin allergy against implant materials who received the coated implant were assessed similarly and compared to a matched-pair group receiving the same implant. There were no differences in function and QoL between the assessed groups at any follow-up. The majority of patients demonstrated no elevation of the measured blood cytokines. Cytokine patterns showed no differences between study groups at any follow-up. The allergy patients demonstrated slower functional improvement and minor differences in cytokine pattern. Yet these results were not significant. There were no differences in the matched-pair analysis. We observed no relevant increase in serum cytokine levels in any group. The inflammatory response measured seems limited, even in allergy patients. Furthermore, there were no differences between coated and standard TKA in non-allergy patients in the 3-year Follow-Up period. The study protocol was registered in the US National Institutes of Health's database ( http://www. gov ) registry under NCT03424174 on 03/17/2016.","Tille Eric, Beyer Franziska, Lützner Cornelia, Postler Anne, Thomas Peter, Summer Burkhard, Lützner Jörg",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Quality of Life, Knee Prosthesis, Knee Joint, Hypersensitivity, Cytokines, Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Treatment Outcome, Osteoarthritis, Knee",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38098024/,"University Center of Orthopaedic, Trauma and Plastic Surgery, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Fetscherst. 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany. eric.tille@gmail.com.; University Center of Orthopaedic, Trauma and Plastic Surgery, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Fetscherst. 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany.; Department of Dermatology und Allergology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany."
38093649,"Increased risk of aseptic loosening for posterior stabilized compared with posterior cruciate-retaining uncemented total knee replacements: a cohort study of 13,667 knees from the Dutch Arthroplasty Registry.","While registry studies have suggested a higher risk of revision for posterior-stabilized (PS) compared with posterior cruciate-retaining (CR) total knee replacements (TKR) using cement, it is unknown whether this is also the case for uncemented TKR. We aimed to compare the revision rates of PS and CR designs in patients receiving primary uncemented TKR. Data from the Dutch arthroplasty register (LROI) was analyzed, comprising 12,226 uncemented primary CR TKRs and 750 uncemented PS TKRs registered between 2007 and 2022. Competing risk and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to compare revision rates, risks of revision, and reasons for revision between groups. Sensitivity analyses were performed to analyze the risk, concerning the 5 most commonly used implants and performing hospitals for each group. Uncemented PS TKRs had higher 10-year revision rates for any reason and aseptic loosening (6.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6-9.2 and 3.9%, CI 2.6-6.7) compared with uncemented CR TKRs (4.2%, CI 3.8-4.7 and 1.4%, CI 1.2-1.7). PS TKRs were 1.4 and 2.5 times more likely to be revised for any reason and aseptic loosening, respectively. These results remained consistent after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, previous surgeries, bearing mobility, and surface modification, with sensitivity analyses. We found that uncemented PS implants have a higher rate of revision than uncemented CR implants, mainly due to a higher risk of aseptic loosening.","Puijk Raymond, Sierevelt Inger N, Pijls Bart G C W, Spekenbrink-Spooren Anneke, Nolte Peter A",Acta orthopaedica,"Humans, Cohort Studies, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Failure, Prosthesis Design, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Reoperation, Registries",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38093649/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Spaarne Gasthuis, Hoofddorp.

38092159,KLIC Score Does Not Predict Failure After Early Prosthetic Joint Infection: An External Validation With 153 Knees and 130 Hips.,"A preoperative risk score, the KLIC score (chronic renal failure [K], liver cirrhosis [L], indication of the index surgery [I], cemented prosthesis [C], and C-reactive protein >115 mg/L), has been developed to predict the risk of treatment failure after early prosthetic joint infection (PJI). This study aimed to validate the KLIC score for the debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) procedure and one-stage revisions in a Northern European cohort. Revisions due to early PJI of the hip or knee between January 1, 2008, and September 12, 2021, were identified retrospectively. The primary outcome was early failure, which was considered when the patient needed an unscheduled surgery, the patient died, or the patient was prescribed long-term suppressive antibiotics. To examine the association between KLIC score and failure risk, univariable logistic regression with area under the curve (AUC) was used. In addition, models were calibrated to assess prognostic ability and clinical utility was examined with decision-curve analyses. An increase in KLIC score had a moderate predictive value for early failure after DAIR (odds ratio [OR] 1.45; confidence interval [CI] 1.13 to 1.90). For one-stage revision, it was only slightly predictive of failure (OR 1.20; CI 0.93 to 1.56). After 60 days, the AUC for DAIR was 0.63 (CI 0.55 to 0.72) and 0.56 (CI 0.46 to 0.66) for one-stage revisions, indicating poor discriminative ability. The decision-curve analyses revealed that the model did not offer a remarkable net benefit across a range of threshold probabilities. We demonstrated that the KLIC score is not a reliable predictor of early failure after early PJI in a Northern European cohort. Using the model to guide treatment decisions does not provide any additional clinical utility beyond the baseline strategies.","Liukkonen Rasmus, Honkanen Meeri, Eskelinen Antti, Reito Aleksi",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Prosthesis-Related Infections, Male, Female, Aged, Retrospective Studies, Middle Aged, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Treatment Failure, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip, Reoperation, Hip Prosthesis, Knee Prosthesis, Aged, 80 and over, Debridement, C-Reactive Protein, Predictive Value of Tests, Risk Factors, Risk Assessment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38092159/,"Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.; Department of Internal Medicine, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland."
38066256,Load-induced deformation of the tibia and its effect on implant loosening detection.,"CT imaging under external valgus and varus loading conditions and consecutive image analysis can be used to detect tibial implant loosening after total knee arthroplasty. However, the applied load causes the tibia to deform, which could result in an overestimation of implant displacement. This research evaluates the extent of tibia deformation and its effect on measuring implant displacement. Ten cadaver specimen with TKA were CT-scanned under valgus/varus loading (20 Nm), first implanted without bone cement fixation (mimicking a loose implant) and subsequently with bone cement fixation (mimicking a fixed implant). By means of image analysis, three relative displacements were assessed: (1) between the proximal and distal tibia (measure of deformation), (2) between the implant and the whole tibia (including potential deformation effect) and (3) between the implant and the proximal tibia (reduced deformation effect). Relative displacements were quantified in terms of translations along, and rotations about the axes of a local coordinate system. As a measure of deformation, the proximal tibia moved relative to the distal tibia by, on average 1.27 mm (± 0.50 mm) and 0.64° (± 0.25°). Deformation caused an overestimation of implant displacement in the cemented implant. The implant displaced with respect to the whole tibia by 0.45 mm (± 0.22 mm) and 0.79° (± 0.38°). Relative to the proximal tibia, the implant moved by 0.23 mm (± 0.10 mm) and 0.62° (± 0.34°). The differentiation between loose and fixed implants improved when tibia deformation was compensated for by using the proximal tibia rather than the whole tibia.","Ter Wee M A, Dobbe J G G, Buijs G S, Kievit A J, Schafroth M U, Maas M, Blankevoort L, Streekstra G J",Scientific reports,"Tibia, Bone Cements, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Prostheses and Implants, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38066256/,"Department of Biomedical Engineering and Physics, Amsterdam UMC Location University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.a.terwee@amsterdamumc.nl.; Amsterdam Movement Sciences, Musculoskeletal Health, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.a.terwee@amsterdamumc.nl.; Department of Biomedical Engineering and Physics, Amsterdam UMC Location University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Amsterdam Movement Sciences, Musculoskeletal Health, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, Amsterdam UMC Location University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Radiology, Amsterdam UMC Location University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."
38061166,A pilot study of intraoperative application of cooled radiofrequency to reduce post-operative pain following total knee arthroplasty.,"Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is a successful treatment for end stage knee osteoarthritis (OA), but can be associated with significant pain in the early post-operative period. Cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) has reported to reduce knee OA pain by targeting the periarticular nerves. The objective of this pilot study was to assess the effectiveness of intra-operative CRFA for reducing pain and opiate use after TKA. This was a non randomised prospective study with control group. Participants were sequentially recruited preoperatively and underwent TKA, with CRFA to 6 targeted sites prior to cementing of implants, and were compared to controls who underwent TKA without CRFA. The primary outcome was Day 3 pain scores, and secondary outcomes included week one pain scores, and opiate use up to six weeks post-operative. 17 participants were recruited to the control group and 12 were recruited to the CRFA group. There was no significant difference in demographics or baseline pain scores between the groups. On day 2 the CRFA group had a lower mean pain VAS score of 3.2 compared to 4.4 in the control group (p = 0.03). The mean post operative VAS pain score did not differ between the groups for Day 1, 3, 4, or any other time points up to 6 weeks. There were no significant reduction in opiate use in the CRFA group compared to the control group. There were no adverse events. This study demonstrated intra-operative CRFA was not effective in reducing pain by 50% after TKA in a pilot study.","Liew Jonathan, Salmon Lucy, Mittal Rajat, Pinczewski Leo",The Knee,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Pilot Projects, Treatment Outcome, Prospective Studies, Knee Joint, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Pain, Postoperative, Opiate Alkaloids",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38061166/,"North Sydney Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine CentreSuite G02, The Mater Clinic, 3 Gillies St Wollstonecraft, NSW, Australia.

We evaluated whether the ATTUNE CR design showed improved clinical results compared with the PFC Sigma CR after 2 years and if there was a difference in tibial component migration. 96 patients with knee osteoarthritis were randomly treated with cemented ATTUNE or PFC Sigma TKA. 42 patients with the ATTUNE and 48 with the PFC Sigma attended the 2-year follow-up. Patient-reported outcome measurements (PROMs), migration measured with RSA, implant position, and the development of radiolucent zones were studied. Non-parametric tests and repeated measures analysis were used at the statistical evaluation. The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) at 2 years (primary outcome) and neither of the secondary PROM outcomes differed between the groups (mean difference OKS ATTUNE - PFC: -0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.9 to 2.7). RSA showed posterior tilt of the tibial component in the ATTUNE group with proximal lift-off anteriorly and subsidence of the tibial tray posteriorly. In contrast, the PFC Sigma tibial component tilted forward (mean difference ATTUNE - PFC: -0.7°, CI -1.1° to -0.4°) with maximum subsidence in the front and maximum lift-off of the posterior edge. The postoperative implant positions and the extension of radiolucent lines around the tibial component at 2 years did not differ. We found no significant differences in clinical outcome between the 2 groups but minor differences in migration pattern of the tibial component. The clinical long-term significance of this finding if any is not known.","Keiller Thom, Saari Tuuli, Sharegi Bita, Kärrholm Johan",Acta orthopaedica,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Follow-Up Studies, Clinical Relevance, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Patient Reported Outcome Measures",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38032279/,"Department of Orthopaedics, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg; Department of Orthopaedics, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Region Västra Götaland, Gothenburg. thom.keiller@artclinic.com.; Department of Orthopaedics, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg; Department of Orthopaedics, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Region Västra Götaland, Gothenburg.; Department of Orthopaedics, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg; Department of Orthopaedics, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Region Västra Götaland, Gothenburg; Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register, Gothenburg, Sweden."

Robotic-assisted (RA) TKA may assist in challenges seen in manual conversion TKA. The aim of this study is to identify if there are differences in components and functional outcomes dependent on manual/RA primary UKA and conversion TKA. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients undergoing conversion from UKA to TKA over a 10-year period at a single institution. Data extracted included surgical technique, reason for UKA failure, range of motion at 1 year, need for augments, and utilization of revision components. Forty-nine patients (50 knees) with a UKA converted to a TKA were divided into 4 groups based on primary and conversion surgery: manual-to-manual (n = 11), manual-to-robot (n = 11), robot-to-manual (n = 11), and robot-to-robot (n = 17). There was no difference in need for augments (<i>P</i> = .376), size of poly (<i>P</i> = .23), postoperative flexion (<i>P</i> = .52), or extension (<i>P</i> = .76) at 1 year between the 4 groups. However, patients with primary manual UKA did require significantly more augments during revision (<i>P</i> = .032). Our study did not show any statistically significant differences of primary RA or manual UKA to RA or manual TKA in terms of range of motion at 1 year, complications, or differences in components.

37980481,Cementing techniques for total knee arthroplasty in Norwegian hospitals; a questionnaire-based study.,"Cementing technique in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) may influence implant survival. There is limited knowledge about the results with clinically used techniques. The aim of this study was to investigate cementing techniques for TKA in Norwegian hospitals, to compare widely used techniques to recommendations from the literature, and to investigate variation within hospitals. A questionnaire requesting information about cementing techniques were distributed to all Norwegian orthopedic surgeons performing TKAs regularly in 2020. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. We acquired 121 responses out of 257 surgeons. They were from 45 out of 56 hospitals, and at least half of the TKA surgeons from 20 hospitals, constituting 79 surgeons. All responders used pulsatile lavage. Cement application to both the tibial plateau and stem (full cementation) was practiced by 61%. Application of cement to both implant and bone was done by 70% of surgeons. Techniques to improve cement penetration were used by 86%. Only 35% of surgeons aimed to get a cement mantle thickness between 3-5 mm. Flexing the knee joint to remove excess cement was done by 82%. We found that in 55% of 20 hospitals the surgeons did not agree on the use of common guidelines in their ward. The majority of the responders used recommended techniques from the literature when cementing TKA. At more than half of the eligible hospitals, surgeons disagreed about their hospitals' use of common guidelines.

37972555,What Drives the Material Costs of Total Knee Arthroplasty in the Operating Room?,"Approximately one-third of US healthcare spending is related to surgical care. Optimizing operating room (OR) spending is crucial, specifically for high-volume procedures like total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Therefore, the primary objective was to identify leading material drivers of cost for TKA procedures within the OR. Patients who underwent a primary, elective TKA from 2018 to 2019 were included (n=8,672). Intraoperative cost details for each TKA patient were captured from the Vizient Clinical Database Resource Manager (CDB/RM) data. Each cost type was categorized into (1) implant, (2) disposables, (3) wound care, and (4) miscellaneous. 7,124 patients undergoing primary TKA were included. Implant-related costs accounted for 87.3% of cost, disposable materials covered 10.7%, and wound care products took 2%. The leading subcategories of implant costs were primary prosthetics (85.1%), revision prosthetics (9.9%), cement (2.8%), and implant instruments (1.7%). Within disposables, surgical products accounted for 81.3% of the cost, patient care products for 8.9%, medical apparel for 7.9%, and electrolytes for 1.8%. For an average individual TKA procedure, 86.4% (±4.4) of total cost went towards the implant, 10.7% (±3.4) towards disposable materials, and 1.6% (±1.4) to wound care products. Within the implant category, 92.5% (± 12.8) of costs were associated with primary implants, 13.3% (± 6.9) with instruments, and 2.5% (± 2.8) with cement. The primary operative material expense category was costs associated with the TKA prosthesis and its fixation followed by disposable materials. A large amount of variation exists in the percent of the total cost for a given TKA procedure that can be attributed to each category.","Simmons Hannah L, Klika Alison K, Pasqualini Ignacio, Rullán Pedro J, Molloy Robert M, Deren Matthew E, Tidd Joshua L, Piuzzi Nicolas S",Surgical technology international,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Operating Rooms, Aged, Female, Male, Middle Aged, Knee Prosthesis, Retrospective Studies, Disposable Equipment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37972555/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.; College of Medicine, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio."
37962469,Simple and cost-effective way to make mobile antibiotic cement spacer: hand-made silicone mold.,"Two-stage exchange arthroplasty is considered the most common approach for the management of prosthetic joint infections. There has been plentiful evidence to support the superiority of the mobile spacers over the static ones. Unfortunately, articulating options are not available in our low-resource environment, which motivated us to come up with an affordable way to create a mobile cement spacer. After experimenting with a variety of materials and producing methods, we realized that silicone is a favorable material for mold building and established a simple process of making a handmade silicone mold. We demonstrate the clinical outcomes of three prosthetic joint infections by using these spacers in the hope of spreading the idea to our colleagues who work in the circumstances of a developing country. Construction of the spacer molds: The molds, consisting of two parts, were shaped by using high viscosity addition silicone (elite HD+ putty soft, Zhermack SpA, Italy) as material, and previously removed implants as template. They were sterilized using ethylene oxide treatment before being ready for casting antibiotic-loaded bone cement spacer. Three cases of prosthetic infection were treated with two-stage revision, using antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer cast in hand-made silicone molds. We sought to determine intraoperative complications, postoperative range of motion, and functional scores. All the patients were regularly followed up to identify fractures or dislocation of the spacer, and reinfection. At the end of the follow-up, all three patients had the infection eradicated. The three patients could sit comfortably with bent knees, walk with partial weight-bearing, and achieve 75-80 degrees of knee flexion in the first week after surgery. Follow-up X-rays revealed no fractures or dislocation in any of the spacers. Silicone molds offer a simple and cost-effective alternative to costly commercial products in producing articulating spacers. Treating infected joints arthroplasty with these spacers allows for early motion and partial weight bearing and improves patient satisfaction and life quality before reimplantation without significant complications.","Nguyen Quang Ton Quyen, Vo Ta Hoc, Phan Duc Tri, Truong Nguyen Khanh Hung",SICOT-J,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37962469/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Tam Anh Hospital, Ha Noi, Vietnam.; Orthopedic and Trauma Department, Dong Nai General Hospital, Dong Nai, Vietnam.; Orthopedic and Trauma Department, Da Nang Hospital, Da Nang, Vietnam.; Orthopedic and Trauma Department, Cho Ray Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."

The data points collected are essential to interpret and analyze data and to understand confounding variables and other sources of bias, which can impair retrospective observational research. The aim of this study was to review all national joint replacement registries to assess what data points are recorded, and in what manner, for primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) so that improvements can be made to enhance data collection, interpretation, and analysis. All national registries were identified through Internet and publication search and contacted to invite participation. Data collection forms for both primary and revision THA and TKA were requested. Data collected were entered into an Excel spreadsheet. The study group for primary and revision THA consisted of 28 national registries, with 26 agreeing to participate. The study group for primary TKA consisted of 27 national registries, with 24 agreeing to participate. Patient identification details were recorded uniformly. Only a minority recorded patient details beyond American Society of Anesthesiologists and body mass index. Most registries did not record surgeon variables: who actually performed or assisted the procedure and their level of training. There was variation in the degree of detail recorded for diagnosis, mostly regarding secondary causes of osteoarthritis and fracture. The details regarding case complexity were limited. Half recorded previous operations, and fewer recorded bone defects. The location of knee arthritis, preoperative limb alignment, and deformities were rarely recorded. Surgical approach and technological adjuncts were routinely collected, but few other details on the surgical technique were recorded. Implant details and fixation were uniformly collected, although a minority recorded specific details, including cement antibiotic or cementing technique. It was uncommon to record whether additional or adjunctive procedures were concurrently performed. Approximately half the registries lacked a revision specific form. The majority recorded reoperations in addition to revision procedures. Patient, surgeon, case, and postoperative details were recorded similar to primary procedures. There was variation in the degree of details recorded for the reasons underlying the revision +/- reoperation, with most recording greater detail for infection and fracture. Many included details on case complexity and bone defects, including the severity, classification, and how the defect was managed. The majority recorded the specific revision procedure that was performed (total or partial), the fixation used, and the components removed or revised. Other specific aspects of fixation including acetabular screws, cone or sleeve use, stems, and augments were less commonly recorded. Substantial data are recorded by all registries, although each one is different. Data solicited lack many patient factors, surgeon variables, case complexity, and surgical techniques. Separate revision forms are not universal, and many registries do not record reoperation procedures, specific causes of revision, and the revision construct. Level II, therapeutic study.

A retrospective consecutive study of patients with minimal metaphyseal bone loss who underwent aseptic rTKA with press-fit cementless femoral stems and short cemented tibial stems. Primary outcome measure was mechanical failure. Surgical complications, reoperations and revision for any cause were collected and Knee society score at final follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate implant survivorship. Seventy-three patients were included with minimum 5 years follow-up with a mean age of 74.5 years. At mean follow-up of 8.5 years (range 5-10), only two patients required revision, both for infection. Radiographic evaluation was undertaken for all remaining patients at final follow-up and showed no evidence of mechanical failure. Six patients (8.4%) showed non-progressive radiolucent lines around the cementless femoral stem with only one having a pedestal at the tip of the femoral stem and four patients (5.6%) showed non-progressive radiolucent lines around the cemented tibial stem. Mean KSS score was 80.6 (standard deviation 13.8) indicating satisfactory clinical outcomes. Using ""any cause implant revision"" as an end point, implant survivorship for this construct was 97.3% at mean 8.5 years. In our experience, a hybrid fixation technique with a press-fit cementless femoral stem and a short-cemented tibial stemmed construct achieves excellent medium- to long-term outcomes in aseptic condylar revision cases with minimal metaphyseal bone loss.","Matar Hosam E, Bawale Rajesh, Gollish Jeffrey D",Journal of long-term effects of medical implants,"Humans, Aged, Survivorship, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Retrospective Studies, Reoperation, Femur",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37938204/,"Nottingham Elective Orthopaedic Services, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham NG5 1PB, UK; Sunnybrook Holland Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.; Sunnybrook Holland Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.; Holland Orthopaedic and Arthritic Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences, Toronto, Canada."
37925803,Fifteen-year survival analysis of an oxidised zirconium total knee arthroplasty.,"Early studies have found Oxidised Zirconium (OxZr-Nb) total knee arthroplasties to have a low incidence of failure in young, high demand patients. Theoretically this is because they are low friction and hard wearing. However, there are a paucity of studies reporting on the outcome of these implants beyond ten years. The purpose of our study was to present an in-depth 15-year survival analysis of a cemented OxZr-Nb knee arthroplasty. Data was collected prospectively and survival analysis undertaken with multiple strict end-points. Complication rates and patient reported outcomes were measured post-operatively. Six hundred and seventeen knee arthroplasties were analysed. Forty-nine patients required a reoperation for various reasons. Aseptic tibial loosening was the most common cause of failure (32.7%), occurring, on average, 2.8 years after the primary procedure. There was only one oxidised zirconium femoral failure recorded.

37924989,Cementless and Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasties Have Similar Outcomes but Cementless Patellar Component Migration was Observed in a Paired Randomized Control Trial.,"Cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has become increasingly popular. Some surgeons are concerned about pain, implant stability, and metal-backed patellar component survivorship. This study investigated the outcomes of cementless compared with cemented TKA in bilateral cases. We randomized 80 knees in 40 osteoarthritic knee patients who underwent bilateral TKA with patellar resurfacing under one anesthesia. All participants received cementless prostheses in one knee and cemented prostheses in the other. The outcomes were knee function measured by the forgotten joint scores, modified Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, knee ranges of motion, pain levels, operative times, radiographic outcomes, and complications. All knees were followed for a minimum of 2 years (2 to 3 years). Cementless and cemented TKA had similar functional outcomes in forgotten joint score (97 ± 5 versus 98 ± 3 points, P = .52), modified Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score (3 ± 4 versus 3 ± 2 points, P = .96), and ranges of motion (134 ± 7° versus 134 ± 7°, P = .16). The postoperative pain was also similar (P > .05). There were 4 cementless patellar components had superior migration for an average of 3.5 mm (range, 1.77 to 4.16) without loosening. The mean time of migration was 4 (range, 2 to 6) weeks. Cementless TKA had similar functional outcomes and recovery patterns compared with cemented TKA. However, there was concern of cementless component migration at patellae.","Tanariyakul Yot, Kanitnate Supakit, Tammachote Nattapol",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Knee Joint, Pain, Postoperative, Osteoarthritis, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37924989/,"Department of Orthopaedics, Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand."
37918693,Use of dual mobility cup cemented into a tantalum acetabular shell for hip revision with large bone loss can decrease dislocation risk without increasing the risk of mechanical failure.,"Porous tantalum components and augments have demonstrated short to midterm fixation stability in acetabular total hip arthroplasty (THA) revision but do not offer a novel option to decrease the postoperative dislocation rate. Recently, dual mobility (DM) cups have gained interest to decrease the prevalence of recurrent hip instability after revision hip arthroplasty, but this issue was not confirmed combined with use of tantalum reconstruction devices. Therefore, we did a retrospective study aiming to: (1) evaluate at a 5-year minimum follow-up period the dislocation rate (and other intra- and postoperative complications), (2) assess radiographic results specifically looking at osseointegration and restoration of the hip center, (3) and also clinical results in a cohort of patients who underwent complex acetabular reconstruction with trabecular metal revision components associated with a cemented DM socket. Using a DM socket cemented in porous tantalum components can reach the low risk of hip dislocation reported with DM components in revision setting without increasing the risk of a mechanical failure. A cross-sectional study identified 174 THA revision including an acetabular revision. Were excluded 118 revisions with acetabular defects Type 1, 2a or 2B according to Paprosky's classification, as well as 18 hips revised without a dual mobility and 3 patients (3 hips) lost to follow-up. Were thus included in this study 35 hips (35 patients) implanted with uncemented total hip arthroplasty revision using both trabecular metal acetabular cup-cage reconstruction and a cemented DM cup. Seven hips were classified Paprosky types 2C, 15 type 3A and 13 types 3B. Patients were followed with clinical and radiological evaluation regarding dislocation rate, infection, reoperation or re-revision, osseointegration and restoration of the hip center, and functional results according to the Harris hip score and psoas impingement presence. At a mean follow-up of 8.1±1.8 years (5.1-12.6), one dislocation was recorded, and one acute deep infection. No patient required a cup re-revision for septic or aseptic loosening. The survivorship at 8years regarding revision for any cause as an endpoint was 96.5% (CI95%: 92-99). Osseointegration of TM implants was analyzed and found no acetabular migration at the last follow-up in the cohort. The mean hip center position was optimized from 48±7mm (37-58) to 34±5mm (29-39) vertically and from 26±5mm (-18-36) to 24±8mm (7-31) horizontally without reaching significance (p=0.1). On the last follow-up X-rays, the mean acetabular inclination was 47̊±9̊ (32̊-61̊). According to the criteria of Hirakawa, 97.1% (34/35) of the hip centers were restored. One cup (2.9%) was more than 5mm proximally from the hip center, and none more than 10mm. Clinical results assessed a Harris Hip Score improved from 36±17 (23-62) preoperatively to 82±15 (69-93) at last follow-up (p<0.0001). Two patients (2/35, 5.7%) complained of psoas impingement. This study suggests effectiveness of DM cups in association with a tantalum-made acetabular shell for reconstruction of large bone defect in THRs for both solving postoperative instability and aseptic loosening without increasing the re-revision rate for any reason in a midterm follow-up.

37907075,No difference in component migration at five years between the cemented cruciate-retaining ATTUNE and PFC-Sigma knee prosthesis: an update of a randomized clinical radiostereometry trial.,"Conflicting clinical results are reported for the ATTUNE Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated five-year follow-up results comparing cemented ATTUNE and PFC-Sigma cruciate retaining TKAs, analyzing component migration as measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA), clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and radiological outcomes. A total of 74 primary TKAs were included in this single-blind RCT. RSA examinations were performed, and PROMs and clinical outcomes were collected immediate postoperatively, and at three, six, 12, 24, and 60 months' follow-up. Radiolucent lines (RLLs) were measured in standard anteroposterior radiographs at six weeks, and 12 and 60 months postoperatively. At five-year follow-up, RSA data from 61 patients were available and the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) of the femoral components were: ATTUNE: 0.96 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.14) and PFC-Sigma 1.37 mm (95% CI 1.18 to 1.59) (p < 0.001). The PFC-Sigma femoral component migrated more in the first postoperative year, but stabilized thereafter. MPTM of the tibial components were comparable at five-year follow-up: ATTUNE 1.12 mm (95% CI 0.95 to 1.31) and PFC-Sigma 1.25 mm (95% CI 1.07 to 1.44) (p = 0.438). RLL at the medial tibial implant-cement interface remained more prevalent for the ATTUNE at five-year follow-up compared to the PFC-Sigma (20% vs 3%). RLL did not progress over time, and varied between patients at different timepoints for both TKA systems. Clinical outcomes and PROMs improved compared with preoperative scores, and were not different between groups. MTPM migration at five-year follow-up of the femoral and tibial component of the ATTUNE were similar and as low as that of the PFC-Sigma. MTPM migration of both knee implants did not significantly change from one year post-surgery, indicating stable fixation. Long-term ATTUNE performance may be expected to be comparable to the clinically well-performing PFC-Sigma. We have not found evidence of increased tibial component migration as measured by RSA to support concerns about cement debonding and a higher risk of aseptic loosening with the ATTUNE TKA.","Yüksel Yasin, Koster Lennard A, Kaptein Bart L, Nelissen Rob G H H, den Hollander Peter",The bone & joint journal,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Radiostereometric Analysis, Treatment Outcome, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Follow-Up Studies, Bone Cements, Prosthesis Design, Prosthesis Failure, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37907075/,"Department of Orthopaedics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.; Focuskliniek Orthopedie, Haaglanden Medical Center, The Hague, Netherlands."
37889315,[Register data on cemented arthroplasty : A proof for cementless fixation?].,"Hip and knee implants can be either fixated without cement, press-fit, or with bone cement. Real-world data from arthroplasty registers, as well as studies, provide a broad database for the discussion of cemented versus uncemented arthroplasty procedures. What is the recommendation for cemented or cementless anchorage of hip and knee implants based on the current evidence from international arthroplasty registries and meta-analyses? A recommendation is generated by means of a direct comparison of data from the arthroplasty registries of eight different countries (USA, Germany, Australia, UK, Sweden, Norway, New Zealand, and The Netherlands), the comparison of 22 review studies and meta-analyses based on registry data, as well as the evaluation of the recommendation of healthcare systems of different nations. For this purpose, reviews and meta-analyses whose results were statistically significant were selected, as were the annual reports of the arthroplasty registries that were current at the time of writing. For knee endoprostheses, a long survival time, as well as a lower risk of revision can be achieved with the help of cemented anchorage with antibiotic-laden bone cement. In patients aged 70 years and older, cemented anchorage of the hip stem implant significantly reduces the risk of intraoperative or postoperative periprosthetic fracture (times four), this applies both to elective total hip arthroplasties (TEPs) and to hemiarthroplasty after femoral neck fractures. Antibiotic-loaded bone cement significantly (p = 0.041) reduces the risk of periprosthetic infection, especially in patients with femoral neck fractures. Total knee replacement with antibiotic-loaded bone cement is well established in Germany and evidence based. Registry data and meta-analyses recommend cemented fixation of the hip stem in older patients-in Germany the evidence-based recommendations must still be transferred to daily practice.","Humez Martina, Kötter Katharina, Skripitz Ralf, Kühn Klaus-Dieter","Orthopadie (Heidelberg, Germany)","Humans, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Hip Prosthesis, Bone Cements, Prosthesis Failure, Reoperation, Prosthesis Design, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Femoral Neck Fractures",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37889315/,"Heraeus Medical GmbH, Philipp-Reis-Str. 8/13, 61273, Wehrheim, Deutschland. martina.humez@mikrobio.med.uni-giessen.de.; Heraeus Medical GmbH, Philipp-Reis-Str. 8/13, 61273, Wehrheim, Deutschland.; Zentrum für Endoprothetik, Fußchirurgie, Kinder- und Allgemeine Orthopädie, Roland-Klinik Bremen, Bremen, Deutschland.; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma, Medizinische Universität Graz, Graz, Österreich."

Secondary aims included reporting PROMs trajectory, 15-year implant survival, and patient attrition from follow-up. From 2006 to 2007, 462 consecutive cemented cruciate-retaining Triathlon TKAs were implanted in 426 patients (mean age 69 years (21 to 89); 290 (62.7%) female). PROMs (12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), and satisfaction) were assessed preoperatively and at one, five, ten, and 15 years. Kaplan-Meier survival and univariate analysis were performed. At 15 years, 28 patients were lost to follow-up (6.1%) and 221 patients (51.9%) had died, with the mean age of the remaining cohort reducing by four years. PROMs response rates among surviving patients were: one-year 63%; five-year 72%; ten-year 94%; and 15-year 59%. OKS and SF-12 scores changed significantly over 15 years (p < 0.001). The mean improvement in OKS was 18.8 (95% confidence (CI) 16.7 to 19.0) at one year. OKS peaked at five years (median 43 years) declining thereafter (p < 0.001), though at 15 years it remained 17.5 better than preoperatively. Age and sex did not alter this trajectory. A quarter of patients experienced a clinically significant decline (≥ 7) in OKS from five to ten years and from ten to 15 years. The SF-12 physical component score displayed a similar trajectory, peaking at one year (p < 0.001). Patient satisfaction was 88% at one, five, and ten years, and 94% at 15 years. In all, 15-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 97.6% (95% CI 96.0% to 99.2%) for any revision, and 98.9% (95% CI 97.9% to 99.9%) for aseptic revision. Improvements in PROMs were significant and maintained following single radius TKA, with OKS peaking at five years, and generic physical health peaking at one year.

37843609,Development of application and surgical technique of total knee arthroplasties: a systematic comparative analysis using worldwide registers.,"The aim was to compare total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between countries with regard to epidemiologic data and surgical technique by the use of worldwide registers and compare findings with a previous report after one decade. A systematic search was carried out in November 2022 and compared to previous reports from 2010. We extracted data regarding implanted TKAs, patients' age distribution, procedure types, fixation and revision rates. After identification of 28 national arthroplasty registers, 8of them, namely Australia, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland and Sweden, offered sufficient data and were included in final analysis. A large variation was found in the annual number of implantations per 100,000 inhabitants with a range from 77 to 210.2 (mean 132.8). The fixation type varied strongly as well, e.g. over 95% of totally cemented TKAs in Sweden versus 61.2% cemented fixation in Denmark. Another significant difference was the use of patellar resurfacing in TKA, ranging from 47.3% (Canada) using a patellar button in TKA to less than 5% (Sweden). Within the period of one decade, the mean overall number of annual implantations increased (10%), whilst relative number of revisions decreased, the use of cemented TKA decreased from 87 to 74%, and the use of patella button remained largely inhomogeneous. Comparison of arthroplasty registers revealed large differences regarding the annual number of primary TKAs per inhabitant as well as primary TKA procedure types with an increase of annual implantations, decrease of relative number of revisions, and a decrease of the use of cemented systems over the period of one decade.","Leitner Lukas, Hauer Georg, Rasic Laura, Clar Clemens, Leithner Andreas, Sadoghi Patrick",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Prosthesis Failure, Reoperation, Registries, Knee Prosthesis, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37843609/,"Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 5, 8036, Graz, Austria.; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 5, 8036, Graz, Austria. patrick.sadoghi@medunigraz.at."

It is hypothesized that this fully cemented construct leads to satisfactory clinical outcomes. A retrospective consecutive study of all patients who underwent a rTKA using the fully cemented SMILES rotating hinge prosthesis between 2005 to 2018. Outcome measures included aseptic loosening, reoperations, revision for any cause, complications, and survivorship. Patients and implant survivorship data were identified through both prospectively collected local hospital electronic databases and linked data from the National Joint Registry/NHS Personal Demographic Service. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used at ten years.

37831197,Long-term clinical and radiological outcome of a cementless titanium-coated total knee arthroplasty system.,"To ensure a high-quality standard, it is important to frequently evaluate different prostheses models to avoid prostheses with high failure rates. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of the uncemented titanium-coated total knee arthroplasty (TKA) system (Advanced Coated System (ACS) III, Implantcast, GERMANY). We hypothesized that the ACS III would have a similar performance as other cemented TKA systems. A total of 540 ACS III mobile-bearing knee joint prostheses were implanted in 495 patients. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Tegner activity score (TAS), knee society score (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) score, and the Short Form 12 (SF-12) score for the evaluation of quality of life (QoL) were taken after at least 9 years of follow-up. In addition, we measured range of motion (ROM) and assessed potential sex differences. In addition, the survival analysis was calculated at a median follow-up of 16.7 years. At the final follow-up, 142 patients had died, and 38 had been lost to follow-up. The rate of revision-free implant survival at 16.7 years was 90.0% (95% CI 87.1-92.2%) and the rate of infection-free survival was 97.0% (IQR 95.2-98.2%). The reasons for revision surgery were aseptic loosening (32.9%), followed by infection (27.1%), inlay exchange (15.9%), and periprosthetic fractures (5.7%). At the clinical follow-up visit, the mean VAS score was 1.9 ± 1.9, the median TAS was 3 (IQR 2-4), and the mean KSS for pain and function were 83.5 ± 15.3 and 67.5 ± 25.2, respectively. The mean WOMAC score was 81.1 ± 14.9, and the median SF-12 scores for physical and mental health were 36.9 (IQR 29.8-45.1) and 55.8 (IQR 46.2-61.0), respectively.

37819600,Excellent mid- to long-term survival of tantalum metal cones in a case series of revision knee arthroplasty with severe bony defects.,"Severe metaphyseal bone defects remain a challenge and represent a growing problem in revision total knee arthroplasty (RTKA). The purpose of this study was to examine the survival of first-generation tantalum metal cones (TMC) and to assess clinical and radiographic data obtained from mid- to long-term follow-ups (FU) after RTKA with severe bony defects. This retrospective case series included 100 consecutive patients of the same centre, who underwent RTKA surgery with TMC for tibia and/or femur bone defects between January 2011 and December 2015. Fourteen patients had died and six were lost for FU, leaving a total of eighty patients (one hundred and twelve TMC) for final evaluation. Clinical parameters including the Knee Society Score (KSS), visual analogue scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and range of motion (ROM) were determined preoperatively based on the patients' medical charts, and assessed again during the final FU after an average of 6.1 (5-9) years postoperative. Standardised postoperative X-rays were analysed during the final FU visit for osseointegration of the cones, and any signs of implant loosening were assessed with the modified Knee Society Radiographic review criteria. Perioperative and postoperative complications, reoperations, as well as implant and cone re-revisions were analysed. Survivorship analysis was performed with (a) cone-related revision for any reason and (b) implant component revision for any reason. Previous RTKA had to be performed due to 64 (80%) aseptic and 16 (20%) septic failures. At the final FU, 75 (94%) tibia and 76 (95%) femur TMCs and implants were clinically stable. One patient experienced loosening of cones and implants at the femur and tibia but denied re-revision surgery. There were eight (10%) reoperations including two early wound healing problems, two inlay changes, two periprosthetic fractures, one debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR), and one secondary patella replacement. The six (7.5%) re-revisions included two aseptic loosening's of the opposite implant without TMC, one arthrodesis for recurrent instability, and three deep infections managed by two two-stage exchanges, and one amputation for persistent infection. At re-revision, all TMC cones were osteointegrated without signs of loosening. The determined clinical parameters showed significant (p < 0.001) postoperative improvement, and objective KSS was rated as excellent in 51%, and as good in 22% of patients at the final FU. The estimated 8-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 95% for TMC and 92.5% for implant components. Tantalum metal cones (TMC) demonstrate a secure fixation for treatment of severe femoral and tibial metaphyseal bone defects during RTKA. This fixation concept showed excellent mid- to long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes with promising 8-year survival rates for cones and implant components.

37806245,Cause for concern? Significant cement coverage in retrieved metaphyseal cones after revision total knee arthroplasty.,"Metaphyseal cones are used to manage bone loss in revision total knee arthroplasty with increasing popularity. Post-operative radiographs and explant procedures suggest that cement may extrude around the cone implant into the cone-bone interface and prevent biologic in- or on-growth. The purpose of this study was to perform a retrieval analysis to describe the pattern of direct cementation onto the porous surface area of metaphyseal cones. Eighteen tibial and femoral cones were identified in an institutional implant retrieval registry. Anterior, posterior, medial and lateral quadrants were digitally mapped for direct cementation, bone ongrowth and fibrous ongrowth were calculated as a percentage of the porous surface area. Plain radiographs from prior to cone explant were analyzed for the presence of cement in all four quadrants and compared with results of the retrieval analysis. Mean bone ongrowth was 25%, direct cementation was 24% (31% in tibial cones) and fibrous ongrowth was 29% of the porous surface area of the retrieved cones. There were no significant differences when comparing patterns of bone or fibrous ongrowth or cementation between anterior, posterior medial and lateral porous surfaces for tibia cones, femoral cones or all cones grouped together. Plain radiographs significantly underestimated the amount of cement covering the cone (p = 0.02). In this retrieval study, we found significant cement extrusion around the porous surface of metaphyseal cones in revision TKAs. Optimizing the cone-bone interface may reduce the risk of cement extrusion and theoretically reduce the risk of aseptic loosening.","Anatone Alex J, Driscoll Daniel A, Flevas Dimitrios A, Baral Elexis C, Chalmers Brian P, Sculco Peter K",The Knee,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis Design, Reoperation, Femur, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37806245/,"Hospital for Special Surgery, 535 E 70th Street, New York, NY 10021, United States."
37760665,A Low Rate of Periprosthetic Infections after Aseptic Knee Prosthesis Revision Using Dual-Antibiotic-Impregnated Bone Cement.,"The incidence of periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) following aseptic knee revision arthroplasty lies between 3% and 7.5%. The aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis that the use of dual-antibiotic-impregnated cement in knee revision arthroplasty leads to a lower rate of periprosthetic joint infections. We retrospectively reviewed 403 aseptic revision knee arthroplasties performed between January 2013 and March 2021 (148 revisions of a unicompartmental prosthesis, 188 revisions of a bicondylar total knee arthroplasty (TKA), 41 revisions of an axis-guided prosthesis, and 26 revisions of only one component of a surface replacement prosthesis). The bone cement Copal G+C (Heraeus Medical, Wertheim, Germany) with two antibiotics-gentamycin and clindamycin-was used for the fixation of the new implant. The follow-up period was 53.4 ± 27.9 (4.0-115.0) months. Five patients suffered from PJI within follow-up (1.2%). The revision rate for any reason was 8.7%. Survival for any reason was significantly different between the types of revision (<i>p</i> = 0.026, Log-Rank-test), with lower survival rates after more complex surgical procedures. The 5-year survival rate with regard to revision for any reason was 91.3% [88.2-94.4%] and with regard to revision for PJI 98.2% [98.7-99.9%], respectively. The use of the dual-antibiotic-impregnated bone cement Copal G+C results in a lower rate of periprosthetic infections after aseptic knee prosthesis replacement than that reported in published prosthesis revisions using only one antibiotic in the bone cement.","Blersch Benedikt Paul, Barthels Michael, Schuster Philipp, Fink Bernd","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37760665/,"Department of Joint Replacement, General and Rheumatic Orthopaedics, Orthopaedic Clinic Markgröningen gGmbH, Kurt-Lindemann-Weg 10, 71706 Markgröningen, Germany.; Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Paracelsus Medical University, Prof. Ernst Nathan Straße 1, 90419 Nuremberg, Germany.; Orthopaedic Department, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany."
37753125,Polyethylene Luxation in an Oxinium Fixed-bearing Unicompartmental Knee Replacement Leading to Metallosis: A Case Reports for an Early and a Late Presentation.,"Polyethylene (PE) subluxation is a rare complication after fixed-bearing unicompartmental knee replacement. We present two cases of PE luxation with a rapid onset of metallosis in a unicompartmental knee replacement made of Oxinium, one early presentation 3 months after surgery and the other case 6 years after. Case 1: A 84-year-old male underwent a fixed-bearing medial unicompartmental knee replacement in his left knee. Standard surgery was carried out with robotic assistance. Three months after surgery, he felt acute pain in the anterior portion of his knee. Radiographs showed that the PE was luxated anteriorly and a radiopaque ""cloud"" that blurs the vision of the implants suggesting metallosis. In the revision surgery, abundant blackish liquid and metallic-like debris were deposited in the synovial tissue and capsule around the knee. The tibial and femoral components presented extensive wear areas, suggesting extensive metal-to-metal contact. Both components were removed, and a posterior stabilized total knee prosthesis was placed. Case 2: A 50-year-old male patient underwent a fixed-bearing medial unicompartmental knee replacement. After 6 years, he complained of insidious pain in the posteromedial side of his knee. During the physical examination, significant joint effusion, a loss of extension, and a limited flexion were observed, with flexion reaching only up to 80°. The patient did not report systemic symptoms associated with metallosis, and no signs of systemic involvement were found. Radiographs show similar findings than in case 1, but the radiopaque ""cloud"" was limited to the knee. In the revision surgery, both components were removed. The tibial and femur components had extensive wear, especially in the posterior-central portion. A posterior stabilized total knee prosthesis was used. Emphasis on careful engagement between the PE and the tibial component is a must, checking that no tissue or cement gets in the way of the anchoring system. Furthermore, prosthesis designs must look for models with a more friendly, engaging system to prevent early presentation. The radiographs assessing the height of the PE - especially in the posterior area - must be carried out. In the case of metallosis and PE luxation, we suggest performing a revision surgery with total knee arthroplasty; however, there is little evidence for a strong recommendation.","Negrin Roberto, Duboy Jaime, Hormazabal Maximiliano, Marin Felipe, Iñiguez Magaly, Barahona Maximiliano",Journal of orthopaedic case reports,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37753125/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Clinica las Condes, 441 Lo Fontecilla Street, Las Condes, Santiago, Chile."
37736767,Application of bone cement directly to the implant in primary total knee arthroplasty. Short-term radiological and clinical follow-up of two different cementing techniques.,"This study aimed to optimize cement application techniques in fully cemented primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) by comparing the effects of two different approaches: cement on bone surface (CoB) versus cement on bone surface and implant surface (CoBaI) on the short-term presence of radiolucent lines (RLL) as indicators of potential complications. In this monocentric study, a total of 379 fully cemented primary TKAs (318 patients) were included. The two study groups were differentiated by the technique of cement application: CoB group (cement applied only on bone surface) and CoBaI group (cement applied on both bone surface and implant surface). The presence of RLL or osteolysis was evaluated using the updated Knee Society Radiographic Evaluation System. In the whole study population, RLL were present in 4.7% of cases, with a significantly higher incidence in the CoBaI group (10.5%) at the 4-week follow-up. At the 12-month follow-up, RLL were observed in 29.8% of TKAs in the CoBaI group, while the incidence was lower in the CoB group (24.0%) (not statistically significant). There were two revisions in each group, none of which were due to aseptic loosening. The findings of this study suggest that the application of bone cement on bone surface only (CoB) may be more beneficial than applying it on both bone surface and implant surface (CoBaI) in terms of short-term presence of RLL in fully cemented primary TKA. Long-term results, especially with regard to aseptic loosening, will be of interest and may provide valuable guidance for future directions in bone cement applications in TKA.","Holzer Lukas A, Finsterwald Michael A, Sobhi Salar, Jones Christopher W, Yates Piers J",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Bone Cements, Follow-Up Studies, Knee Prosthesis, Radiography",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37736767/,"Department of Orthopaedics, Fiona Stanley Fremantle Hospitals Group, 11 Robin Warren Dr., Murdoch, WA, 6150, Australia. info@ortho-holzer.com.; Orthopaedic Research Foundation of Western Australia (ORFWA), Perth, WA, Australia. info@ortho-holzer.com.; Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. info@ortho-holzer.com.; Department of Orthopaedics, Fiona Stanley Fremantle Hospitals Group, 11 Robin Warren Dr., Murdoch, WA, 6150, Australia.; Orthopaedic Research Foundation of Western Australia (ORFWA), Perth, WA, Australia.; Curtin University, Bentley, WA, Australia.; University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia.; Department of Orthopaedics, St. John of God Hospital Murdoch, Murdoch, WA, Australia."
37728200,Risk for re-revision and type of antibiotic-loaded bone cement in hip or knee arthroplasty revisions: report of the Dutch Arthroplasty Register.,"High-dose dual antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC) may reduce the risk of revision after total hip and knee replacements. The aim of our study therefore was to determine the risk of re-revision following first time aseptic hip or knee revision using single versus dual ALBC. Patients from the Dutch Arthroplasty Register treated from 2007 to 2018 with first time cemented aseptic hip (n = 2,529) or knee revisions (n = 7,124) were incorporated into 2 datasets. The primary endpoint of this observational cohort study was subsequent all-cause re-revision. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard and competing risk was analyzed for both groups. There was no difference in re-revision rate (any reason) with single versus dual ALBC (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-1.35 for hip and 0.93, CI 0.80-1.07 for knee revisions). The 10-year crude cumulative re-revision rate also showed no differences for single versus dual ALBC use. The crude cumulative 7-year THA re-revision and 9-year TKA re-revision rates did not show any difference in implant survival for common cement types used. We could not confirm the potential benefit of using dual ALBC compared with single ALBC for aseptic hip and knee revisions.","Bos Pieter K, Spekenbrink-Spooren Anneke, Croughs Peter, Bierma-Zeinstra Sita M A, Reijman Max, Van Oldenrijk Jakob",Acta orthopaedica,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Bone Cements, Knee Joint, Anti-Bacterial Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37728200/,"Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam. p.k.bos@erasmusmc.nl.; Dutch Arthroplasty Register (Landelijke Registratie Orthopedische Interventies), 's-Hertogenbosch.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam.; Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam; Department of General Practice, Erasmus MC University Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam."

It is widely accepted that bone defects filling with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement could be used only in selected cases of small bone defects (up to 5 mm) and less than 50% of articular surface due to multiple reasons: risk of thermal bone damage, inadequate cement pressurization and bone cement shrinkage, etc. Staged cementing for preventing bone heating and over negative effects of cementing on a thick layer of bone cement has limited support in the literature. We present the case of 4.5 years follow up after temporary-permanent spacer implantation in a 63-year-old male with chronic deep knee PJI and tibial AORI type 3 bone defect reconstructed via double cementing method.

37700200,Transillumination method in total knee arthroplasty: new approach with old tools.,"In this study, we evaluated the possibility of precise intraoperative localization of the lateral genicular arteries by an orthopaedic surgeon using the transillumination method. Twelve patients underwent cemented TKA with patella-friendly Zimmer Biomet NexGen Legacy Posterior Stabilized prostheses (without patellar resurfacing), seven right knees and five left knees. The mean age of patients in the study group was 66.636 ± 7.003 years. The minimal follow-up period was 13 months (mean-16.363 ± 2.5 months). Functional outcomes were assessed using Knee Society and a specific patellar questionnaire-Kujala Score. Intraoperative detection of insufficient patellar stability and/or patellar maltracking was based on the no-thumb technique. In pre- and postoperative period X-ray investigation, standard standing X-ray and Merchant view were used to evaluate implant position and patellofemoral congruency. In this study, ten out of twelve knee joints (83.3%) had at least one artery visible by the proposed method in the lateral parapatellar area. Five out of ten knee joints had more than one artery that could be visualized and identified as an arterial vessel. Postoperative Knee Society Score showed significant improvement from a mean 51.181 ± 3.868 to a mean 88.727 ± 3.663. Mean hospital length of stay is 8.545 ± 1.863 days. X-ray assessment using standard anteroposterior, lateral, and Merchant skyline views showed appropriate implant positioning and patellofemoral congruency. The mean Kujala Score in the postoperative period (3 and 6 months) was 67.3 ± 6.75 and 75.6 ± 6.42, respectively. Using the proposed transillumination method can help preserve the lateral blood supply to the patella and to avoid devascularized patella-related complications.

37668648,No Increased Risk of Aseptic Loosening with Tourniquetless Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Our study examined whether risk of revision for aseptic loosening following cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is (1) increased with tourniquetless surgery and (2) affected by patient characteristics or surgical factors. Primary cemented TKAs from 2005-2012 with 2-year follow up were analyzed (n = 5,508 with tourniquet; n=101 without). Revision for aseptic loosening was compared between TKA performed with and without a tourniquet. Patient characteristics were recorded. At mean 4.8-year follow up, risk of aseptic loosening was similar between TKA performed with or without a tourniquet (p = 0.3151). Aseptic loosening was more likely in men (p = 0.0018) and patients younger than 50 (p < 0.0001). No difference was observed between cruciate-retaining and posterior-stabilized implants (p = 0.1250). With the numbers available for study, we did not observe an increased risk of aseptic loosening with tourniquetless cemented primary TKA. Patients younger than 50, particularly men, should be counselled on the increased risk of TKA revision for aseptic loosening.

37663071,High Rates of Aseptic Loosening in Modern Posterior-stabilized Femoral Components From a Single Manufacturer.,Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in the United States. There are concerns and reports of early aseptic loosening due to debonding at the cement-implant interface in a specific posterior-stabilized femoral design. This study describes failure at the cement-implant interface with 2 femoral implant designs produced by a single manufacturer. This is a review of failed primary total knee arthroplasties performed with Optetrak Logic and Truliant posterior-stabilized femoral components between 2010 and 2020. Cases with revision surgery performed for femoral component loosening were reviewed. Seventeen of 896 knees were revised for femoral component loosening. The mean time from index arthroplasty to revision was 73 months. Patients presented with knee pain and recurrent aseptic effusions. More than half of patients had no evidence of component loosening on plain radiographs. Bone scans were positive in 77% of patients with loosening. Femoral components were easily disimpacted from the cement mantle at the time of revision surgery. Patients were treated with femoral only revision or femoral and tibial revision. Two complications occurred in this series. Providers should maintain vigilance in the surveillance of patients with these implants. Clinicians should have a low threshold for additional diagnostic testing if these patients develop pain and/or recurrent effusions. Isolated femoral or complete revision both seem to be acceptable treatment strategies for this failure mechanism.,"Shnaekel Asa, Morrison J Craig",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37663071/,"Southern Joint Replacement Institute, TriStar Centennial Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."
37651549,Continued Stabilization of a Cementless 3D-Printed Total Knee Arthroplasty: Five-Year Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial Using Radiostereometric Analysis.,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing of highly porous orthopaedic implants aims to promote better osseointegration, thus preventing aseptic loosening. However, short-term radiostereometric analysis (RSA) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has shown higher initial migration of cementless 3D-printed tibial components compared with their cemented counterparts. Therefore, critical evaluation of longer-term tibial component migration is needed. We investigated migration of a cementless 3D-printed and a cemented tibial component with otherwise similar TKA design during 5 years of follow-up, particularly the progression in migration beyond 2 years postoperatively. Seventy-two patients were randomized to a cementless 3D-printed Triathlon Tritanium (Stryker) cruciate-retaining (CR) TKA or a cemented Triathlon CR (Stryker) TKA implant. Implant migration was evaluated with RSA at baseline and postoperatively at 3 months and at 1, 2, and 5 years. The maximum total point motion (MTPM) of the tibial component was compared between the groups at 5 years, and progression in migration was assessed between 2 and 5 years. Individual implants were classified as continuously migrating if the MTPM was ≥0.1 mm/year beyond 2 years postoperatively. Clinical scores were evaluated, and a linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze repeated measurements. At 5 years, the mean MTPM was 0.66 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.78 mm) for the cementless group and 0.53 mm (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64 mm) for the cemented group (p = 0.09). Between 2 and 5 years, there was no progression in mean MTPM for the cementless group (0.02 mm; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.10 mm) versus 0.07 mm (95% CI, 0.00 to 0.14) for the cemented group. One implant was continuously migrating in the cementless group, and 4 were continuously migrating in the cemented group. The clinical scores were comparable between the groups across the entire time of follow-up. No significant difference in mean migration was found at 5 years between the cementless and cemented TKA implants. Progression of tibial component migration was present beyond 2 years for the cemented implant, whereas the cementless implant remained stable after initial early migration. Therapeutic Level I .

37640916,Aseptic survival of the 1.5-stage exchange arthroplasty for periprosthetic joint infection was acceptable when using an autoclaved femoral component and a new polyethylene insert.,"To investigate the aseptic survival of 1.5-stage exchange arthroplasty for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Eighty-eight cases of 1.5-stage exchange arthroplasty for PJI without reinfection were retrospectively analysed. The autoclaved femoral component and new polyethylene insert (PE) were implanted using antibiotic mixed cement. The explanted tibial component was not reinserted. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and range of motion were clinically evaluated preoperatively and at the last follow-up (the last time for the implant in situ). Radiographically, hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) and component positions were measured preoperatively, postoperatively (1 month after the 1.5-stage exchange arthroplasty), and at the last follow-up. The survival rate was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method, in which failure was defined as reoperation due to aseptic failure. Mean period to failure and failure site were analysed. Factors affecting survival were investigated in terms of demographics and inappropriateness of the postoperative HKA (HKA > 0 ± 3°) and component positions (α angle > 95 ± 3°, β angle > 90 ± 3°, γ angle > 3 ± 3°, and δ angle > 87 ± 3°). The spacer in-situ time was 3.7 years (0.2-6.4). The clinical results improved hip-knee-ankle significantly at the last follow-up. Radiographically, the average HKA was valgus 0.1° postoperatively. The average α, β, γ, and δ angles of the postoperative component positions were 95.9°, 90.4°, 3.8°, and 86.7°, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 5-year postoperative survival rates were 90.9%, 86.4%, and 80.6%, respectively. The mean period to failure was 2.0 years (0.2-5.3). There were 18 cases of aseptic loosening (20.8%), occurring on both the femur and tibial sides in 1 knee, and only on the tibial side in 17 knees. Inappropriate coronal position of the PE (β angle > 90 ± 3°) was a significant factor affecting survival (odds ratio = 5.491; p = 0.011). The aseptic survival of the 1.5-stage exchange arthroplasty was acceptable when using an autoclaved femoral component and new PE. The appropriate coronal position of the PE helps ensure favourable survival of 1.5-stage exchange arthroplasty.

37637597,Factors Influencing the Clinical Outcomes of Two-Stage Re-Implantation in Patients With Periprosthetic Joint Infection After Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Introduction Infection is one of the most distressing complications of total knee arthroplasty (TKA), requiring a long treatment process and may negatively affect patient satisfaction. All surgeons aim to achieve infection-free survival, painless, functional, and stable knee after treatment of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) with two-stage revision treatment. Many factors play a role in determining clinical outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the factors influencing the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing two-stage revision knee arthroplasty for PJI. Methods Forty-nine patients were retrospectively evaluated. Forty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. Spacer types, growth rates in culture, types and amount of antibiotics added to the cement, and intervals between stages were evaluated. Pre- and post-treatment infection parameters, changes in the range of motion (ROM), clinical and functional (C&F) Knee Society Score (KSS) results, and complications were also studied. Results After a mean follow-up of 48.8 ± 16.5 months, re-infection was detected in five out of 44 patients (10.4%). No significant difference was noted regarding C&F KSS when comparing time intervals between the two stages, whether they were shorter or longer than 10 weeks. However, better ROM results were obtained in patients with less than 10 weeks between stages. The relationship between spacer type, ROM, and C&F KSS was not found to be significant. Particularly, the addition of 4g of teicoplanin to the cement shortened the time between the two stages. Conclusion C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels can be considered safe parameters for diagnosis, reimplantation timing, and follow-up. The use of dynamic spacers or reimplantation performed within 10 weeks after the first stage is associated with better ROM outcomes. Additionally, the addition of teicoplanin to the cement shortened the duration of antibiotic therapy.","Şenel Ahmet, Öztürkmen Yusuf, Eren Murat, Carkci Engin, Circi Esra, Kanay Enes, Açıkgöz İlhan",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37637597/,"Orthopedics and Traumatology, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, TUR."
37634907,Micromotion measurement at the interfaces of cemented tibial endoprosthetic replacements: A new standardized in vitro model using open-cell rigid foam.,"Early aseptic loosening following primary total knee arthroplasty related to several factors might appear at the interface implant-cement or cement-bone. A standardized in vitro model might provide information on the relevance of single variable parameter of cementation including technique and cement respectively bone structure on fixation strength. Micromotion measurement using different directions of load should detect the primary stability of the interfaces. An open-cell rigid foam model was used for cementation of PFC-Sigma tibial trays with Palacos®. Pins were applied to the model for continuous non-destructive measurement. Relative micromotions for rotation, valgus-varus and extension flexion stress were detected at the interfaces as well as cement penetration was measured. The reproducibility of the measurement could be shown for all interfaces in extension-flexion movements. For rotation a negative trend was shown for the interface cement-prosthesis and cement-bone concerning varus-valgus stress reflecting varying surgical cementation technique. More micromotion related to extension-flexion force might reflect the design of the implant. Measurement of relative micromotion and cement distribution appear accurate to detect small differences of movement at different interfaces of cemented tibial implants and the results are reproducible for most parameter. An increased number of specimens should achieve statistical relevance for all measurements.","Fölsch Christian, Ulloa Carlos Alfonso Fonseca, Harz Torben, Schirmer Julia, Glameanu Cosmin, Scherberich Jan, Krombach Gabriele, Rickert Markus, Martin John Ryan, Kühn Klaus-Dieter, Jahnke Alexander",Medical engineering & physics,"Reproducibility of Results, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Artificial Limbs, Bone Cements, Bone Nails",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37634907/,"Department of Orthopaedics and Orthopaedic Surgery, University Hospital Gießen and Marburg (UKGM), Justus-Liebig-University, Klinikstraße 33, 35392 Gießen, Germany; Laboratory of Biomechanics, Justus-Liebig-University Gießen, Klinikstraße 29, 35392 Gießen, Germany.

37629896,The Effects of Different Femoral Component Materials on Bone and Implant Response in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Finite Element Analysis.,"Due to the high stiffness of the biomaterials used in total knee arthroplasty, stress shielding can lead to decreased periprosthetic bone mineral density and bone resorption. As different materials and 3D-printed highly porous surfaces are available for knee femoral components from the industry nowadays, this study aimed to compare the effects of two same-design cruciate-retaining femoral components, made with CoCr and titanium alloy, respectively, on periprosthetic bone stresses through a finite element model of the implanted knee in order to evaluate the induced stress shielding. Moreover, the effect of the cementless highly porous surface of the titanium implant was analyzed in comparison to the cemented interface of the CoCr implant. The von Mises stresses were analyzed in different periprosthetic regions of interest of the femur with different configurations and knee flexion angles. The titanium component induced higher bone stresses in comparison with the CoCr component, mostly in the medial compartment at higher knee flexion angles; therefore, the CoCr component led to more stress shielding. The model was revealed to be effective in describing the effects of different femoral component materials on bone stress, highlighting how a cementless, highly porous titanium femoral component might lead to less stress shielding in comparison to a cemented CoCr implant with significant clinical relevance and reduced bone resorption after total knee arthroplasty.","Galas Allegra, Banci Lorenzo, Innocenti Bernardo","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37629896/,"LaBS, Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering ""G.

The aim of this study was to (1) compare blood loss and transfusion rates between cementless and cemented TKAs and (2) identify the risk factor for higher blood loss in patients who underwent 1-week-interval staggered bilateral (SB) TKA. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This retrospective, propensity-matched study included 54 cementless and 53 cemented SB TKAs performed by a single surgeon from 2019 to 2023 with a single implant that has similar design features in both cementless and cemented implants. All patients underwent 1-week-interval SB TKA and received the same patient blood management (PBM) and rehabilitation protocol. The estimated total blood loss (TBL), transfusion rate, and total hemoglobin drop were assessed. Patients were categorized according to TBL into average TBL and higher TBL groups. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for higher blood loss. <i>Results</i>: There was no difference in TBL between cementless and cemented TKA groups (1233 ± 299 and 1282 ± 309 mL, respectively; <i>p</i> > 0.05). In addition, no between-group differences in the transfusion rate and mean total hemoglobin drop were observed. The logistic regression analyses revealed that whether TKA was cementless or cemented was not associated with higher blood loss; rather, the only identified risk factor was the pre-TKA patient blood volume (odd ratio 1.001, 95% confidence interval 1.000-1002, <i>p</i> = 0.026). <i>Conclusions</i>: Contemporary cementless fixation does not increase blood loss or transfusion rates compared to cemented fixation in patients undergoing 1-week-interval staggered bilateral TKA.","Sohn Sueen, Cho Nicole, Oh Hyunjoo, Kim Yong Deok, Jo Hoon, Koh In Jun","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Propensity Score, Retrospective Studies, Hemorrhage, Hemoglobins",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37629748/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital, College of Medicine, Inje University, Seoul 01757, Republic of Korea.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital, Seoul 01757, Republic of Korea.; Lauren E Wiznia MD PLLC, 1016 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10028, USA.; Joint Replacement Center, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul 03312, Republic of Korea.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea."
37559133,Consequences of using poly-ether-ether-ketone versus traditional implant on tibial cement penetration and short-term clinical outcomes during total knee arthroplasty: a randomized controlled trial.,"The use of poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) prosthesis during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a relatively new concept. Several studies have suggested that the thickness of cement penetration during TKA may affect the stability of the implants. The present study aimed to compare the cement penetration and clinical performance between PEEK and traditional cobalt chromium molybdenum (CoCrMo) prosthesis during TKA. This study was a randomized controlled trial with level I of evidence. A total of 48 patients were randomly assigned to either the PEEK group (n = 24) or the CoCrMo group (n = 24). Mean bone cement penetration under the tibial baseplate was assessed radiographically in four zones in the anteroposterior view and two zones in the lateral view, in accordance with the Knee Society Scoring System. Furthermore, parameters such as the Knee Society Score (KSS), visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, complications and survivorship at 1 year postoperatively were also compared. According to the results of this study, the mean bone cement penetration exhibited no significant difference between PEEK and CoCrMo groups (2.49 ± 0.61 mm vs. 2.53 ± 0.68 mm, p = 0.85). Additionally, there were no remarkable differences in the KSS clinical score, functional score, and VAS score between the two groups. Moreover, complications and survivorship were also statistically compared between the groups and presented no significant differences. Based on the current findings, it can be concluded that PEEK implant present similar bone cement penetration, short-term clinical outcomes, and survivorship with traditional CoCrMo implant in TKA without added complications.

37542541,The fate of fungal periprosthetic joint infection after total knee arthroplasty.,"To demonstrate the clinical outcomes of patients with fungal periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) after two-stage exchange arthroplasty combined with antifungal therapy. We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 41 patients with fungal PJIs after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in a single centre from January 1999 to October 2017. During the first stage of resection arthroplasty, antifungal-impregnated cement spacers (AICSs) were implanted in all patients. After systemic antifungal treatment during the interval between the two surgeries, delayed reimplantation as part of a two-stage exchange protocol was performed when patients were clinically stable. We defined treatment success as a well-functioning arthroplasty without any signs of PJI after a minimum follow-up of two years without antimicrobial suppression. Successful treatment was confirmed by repeat negative cultures as well as a return of inflammatory markers to normal levels. The treatment success rate was 63.4% at the final follow-up. Thirty-six of 41 patients (87.8%) met the criteria for second-stage revision after confirmation of complete infection control. The mean prosthesis-free interval was 6.6 months (range, 2.0-30.0 months). During follow-up after two-stage exchange arthroplasty, ten patients (27.7% of 36 patients) unfortunately experienced recurrence or relapse of infection after an average of 31.3 months (range, 2.7-135.6 months). The rate of survivorship free from reinfection was 94.4% at six months, 84.8% at one year, and 73.6% at two years. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis demonstrated that the prosthesis-free interval (HR = 1.016, p = 0.037) and mean length of antifungal treatment (HR = 0.226, p = 0.046) were potential risk factors for failure. Fungal PJIs led to devastating clinical outcomes despite even two-stage revision arthroplasty with the use of AICSs and antifungal medications.","Yang Hong Yeol, Shin Hyun Ho, Kim Ji Won, Seon Jong Keun",International orthopaedics,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Antifungal Agents, Prosthesis-Related Infections, Retrospective Studies, Treatment Outcome, Arthritis, Infectious, Reoperation, Knee Joint, Knee Prosthesis, Anti-Bacterial Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37542541/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Chonnam National University Medical School and Hospital, 322, Seoyang-ro, 58128, Hwasun, Republic of Korea.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Chonnam National University Medical School and Hospital, 322, Seoyang-ro, 58128, Hwasun, Republic of Korea. seonbell@chonnam.ac.kr."
37539365,Bone Cement Waste in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Preliminary Study of Scope and Cost.,"Medical waste is both costly and detrimental to the environment, and operating room waste represents a substantial portion of this. To the authors' knowledge, bone cement waste in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has not previously been studied. The vast majority of TKA are cemented, and the volume of TKA is forecast to increase. Given this, we studied the waste resulting from the routine use of 2 40-gram bags of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) powder during cementing in primary TKA. We first studied the yield of commercially available plain and gentamicin medium-viscosity bone cement powder and calculated the cost/gram of product. We then collected the PMMA remaining after primary TKA to determine the average amount of waste, its cost, and possible correlations with patient and implant metrics that could improve efficiency and reduce waste of PMMA. Overall, PMMA waste averaged 59% per TKA, at a median cost of $129 per case. Cost of waste was greater when gentamicin cement was used, as its cost was 2.5X that of plain cement. Implant sizes and surface area ranges were identified that could reliably allow the use of a single 40-gram package of powder, potentially reducing PMMA waste. While it is acknowledged that zero-waste cementing is not practical, any reduction in waste that does not compromise either the flow of surgery or the adequacy of fixation would be beneficial. Reevaluation of PMMA techniques could reduce waste, resulting in both cost savings and improved sustainability in arthroplasty.","Tompkins Geoffrey S, Howe Kevin K, Valderrama Rebecca, Sypher Katie, Griffin Michael, Chiu Shih Ting",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37539365/,"Redwood Orthopaedic Surgery Associates, Santa Rosa, CA, USA.; Providence Health Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Institute, Renton, WA, USA.; Providence Health Care, Portland, OR, USA."
37529191,Titanium Alloy Knee Implant Is Associated with Higher Bone Density over Cobalt Chromium: A Prospective Matched-Pair Case-Control Study.,"Little is known about the relationship between implant material and periprosthetic bone mineral density (pBMD) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was to investigate the change in pBMD after TKA and to compare pBMD changes between two different implant materials. A prospective matched-pair case-control study was conducted on 29 patients who underwent bilateral TKAs. The participants were randomly allocated to undergo cemented TKAs with a titanium nitride (TiN)-coated implant on one knee (TiN group) and a cobalt-chromium (CoCr) implant on the other knee (CoCr group). The pBMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans before surgery and at 1 and 2 years after surgery. The results were then compared between the two groups. The pBMDs at longer follow-ups (> 2 years) were estimated using simple radiographs (pBMDe). At 2 years after surgery, the pBMD significantly decreased in both groups at medial metaphysis of the tibia and anterior portion of the distal femur (all <i>p</i> < 0.001). The CoCr group showed a larger decrease in pBMD than did the TiN group in the medial and anterior metaphysis of the proximal tibia (<i>p</i> = 0.003 and <i>p</i> = 0.046, respectively). The pBMDe was significantly higher in the TiN group at the anterior portion of the distal femur 7 years after surgery (<i>p</i> = 0.019). The pBMD significantly decreased 2 years after TKA in certain regions regardless of the implant material used. However, the decrease was significantly less in the TiN group in specific regions of the tibia and femur. The TiN implant was beneficial in preserving the periprosthetic bone stock after TKA.","Lee Do Weon, Ro Du Hyun, Han Hyuk-Soo, Lee Myung Chul",Clinics in orthopedic surgery,"Humans, Alloys, Bone Density, Case-Control Studies, Chromium, Cobalt, Knee Prosthesis, Prospective Studies, Titanium",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37529191/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Korean Armed Forces Daegu Hospital, Gyeongsan, Korea.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.; CONNECTEVE Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea."
37521733,Femoral Component Fracture in a Total Knee Arthroplasty Patient With a Persistent Flexion Contracture.,"This article reports a rare case of a total knee arthroplasty femoral component fracture. Fractures of early knee systems were attributed to design flaws. Modern design failures have been attributed to poor surgical technique or underlying osteolysis. Here, we report a fracture in the Vanguard prosthesis (Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, IN) 12 years after implantation in a patient with a persistent flexion contracture. The fracture likely occurred due to fatigue failure of the anterior flange secondary to increased stress from a high riding patella. Although femoral component fractures are rare, they should be considered as a potential complication, especially in patients with special load considerations. For these patients, it is essential that the prosthesis be properly supported with clean cuts and an adequate cement mantle.","Tate Jackson P, Schneider Andrew M, Brown Nicholas M",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37521733/,"Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, IL, USA.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL, USA."
37521088,Cementless Compared to Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty is Associated With More Revisions Within 1 Year of Index Surgery.,"Cementless total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) have gained renewed interest due to improved implant designs and lower rates of revision than its cemented counterparts. The purpose of this study was to compare revision rates between cemented vs cementless TKAs within 1 year of primary arthroplasty. This was a retrospective review from the PearlDiver Patient Record Database. International Classification of Diseases and Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to identify patients who had undergone cemented and cementless TKAs and subsequent surgical revisions. An unadjusted univariate analysis of patient demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, and surgical revisions at 90 days and 1 year after TKA was performed using chi-squared testing. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were subsequently performed for 1-year surgical complications requiring revision. Of 324,508 patients, 312,988 (96.45%) underwent cemented TKAs, and 11,520 (3.55%) underwent cementless TKAs. Patients undergoing cementless TKA tended to be younger than patients undergoing cemented TKA (63.67 ± 9.15 cementless vs 66.22 ± 8.85 cemented, <i>P</i> < .001). Univariate chi-squared testing showed that cementless patients were more likely to require 1-component femoral or tibial revision at 90 days and 1 year, irrigation and debridement at 90 days and 1 year, and arthroscopy with lysis of adhesions at 1 year only. Similar findings were observed for these 3 revision procedures at 1 year after correcting for age, gender, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score using multivariate logistic regression analysis as cementless TKA patients had higher odds ratios for each of the revisions. Small but significant differences were found in surgical revisions among cementless TKAs when compared to cemented TKAs within 1 year of the index procedure.","Chiou Daniel, Li Alan K, Upfill-Brown Alexander, Arshi Armin, Hsiue Peter, Chen Kevin, Stavrakis Alexandra, Photopoulos Christos Demetris",Arthroplasty today,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37521088/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA."
37516985,Does lucency equate to revision? A five-year retrospective review of Attune and Triathlon total knee arthroplasty.,"The Attune<sup>®</sup> total knee arthroplasty system was introduced in 2013 to address lingering issues of patient dissatisfaction. However, recent literature reports concerns of early tibial tray debonding. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of radiolucent lines, survivorship and patient reported outcome-measures between the Attune<sup>®</sup> system and the well-established Triathlon<sup>®</sup> system. This retrospective database review was conducted at a single institution in Cork, Ireland. All primary Attune<sup>®</sup> (N = 445) and Triathlon<sup>®</sup> (N = 285) systems implanted between 2015 and 2016 were reviewed. Radiolucent lines were assessed for those with a minimum two-year radiological follow-up (Attune<sup>®</sup> = 338; Triathlon<sup>®</sup> = 231). X-rays were taken post op, at 6 months, 2 years and 5 years. Radiolucent lines were documented using the Modern Knee Society Radiographic System. Five-year survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis with the Log Rank method to determine statistical significance. The Oxford Knee Score and EQ-5D-5L, were collected pre-op, at 6 months, 2 years and 5 years post-operatively and compared using the Kruskal-Wallis Test. The Attune<sup>®</sup> had a higher proportion of radiolucent lines at the tibial tray [87.1% (54/62) vs 61.4% (27/44); p = 0.001] and at the implant-cement interface [62.9% (39/62) vs 43.2% (19/44); p = 0.02]. Conversely, the Triathlon<sup>®</sup> had a higher proportion AT the femur [38.6% (17/44) vs 12.9% (8/62); p = 0.001] and at the cement-bone interface [56.8% (25/44) vs 37.1% (23/62); p = 0.02]. The overall frequency of radiolucent lines was similar in both the Attune<sup>®</sup> and Triathlon<sup>®</sup> groups [17.8%, (60/338) vs 17.7%, (41/231); p = 0.49]. There was no difference in revision-free survival analysis at 5 years (Attune<sup>®</sup> 97.8% vs Triathlon<sup>®</sup> 95.8%; p = 0.129). The Attune<sup>®</sup> performed better at 5 years in the Oxford Knee Score [Attune<sup>®</sup> = 42.6 (SD 5.2) vs Triathlon<sup>®</sup> = 41 (SD 6.4); p = 0.001] and in the EQ-5D [Attune<sup>®</sup> = 0.773 (SD 0.187) vs Triathlon<sup>®</sup> = 0.729 (SD 0.218); p = 0.013]. There was no difference at 5 years in the EQ-VAS [Attune<sup>®</sup> = 80.4 (SD 13.7) vs Triathlon<sup>®</sup> = 78.5 (SD 15.3); p = 0.25]. The Attune<sup>®</sup> system exhibited a higher incidence of  radiolucent lines at the tibial tray. However, this did not lead to decreased survivorship at medium term follow-up compared to the Triathlon<sup>®</sup>. Furthermore, improvements in patient reported outcomes modestly favoured the Attune<sup>®</sup> system.

37508249,Total Knee Arthroplasty in Unrecognized Septic Arthritis-A Descriptive Case Series Study.,"Synovitis, like that associated with chronic bacterial arthritis, is a very rare finding during the implantation of knee endoprostheses. In such cases, we fix the knee prostheses with cement containing two antibiotics and carry out a course of systemic antibiotic administration. The aim was to analyze these cases for incidence, detection of bacteria, risk factors, and outcome. Out of 7534 knee replacements between January 2013 and December 2020, 25 cases were suspected during the surgical procedure to have suffered from bacterial arthritis and were treated accordingly. Total synovectomy was carried out, whereby five intraoperative synovial samples were examined bacteriologically, and the complete synovitis was analyzed histologically. The mean follow-up was 65.3 ± 27.1 (24-85) months. In nine cases (0.12%), the diagnosis of bacterial arthritis was made histologically and by clinical chemistry (elevated CRP), and in two of these cases, pathogen verification was performed. Eight of these nine patients had previously had injections or surgery associated with the corresponding knee joint or had an underlying immunomodulatory disease. None of the patients developed a periprosthetic infection at a later stage. With an incidence of 0.12%, it is rare to unexpectedly detect bacterial synovitis during surgery. Total synovectomy, use of bone cement with two antibiotics, and immediate systemic antibiotic therapy seem to keep the risk of periprosthetic infection low.","Sax Florian Hubert, Fink Bernd","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37508249/,"Department of Joint Replacement, General and Rheumatic Orthopaedics, Orthopaedic Clinic Markgröningen gGmbH, Kurt-Lindemann-Weg 10, 71706 Markgröningen, Germany.; Orthopaedic Department, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany."

37405274,Mechanisms of bone loss in revision total knee arthroplasty and current treatment options.,"Primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective treatment which is increasing in use for both elderly and younger patients. With the overall increasing life span of the general population, the rate of revision TKA is projected to increase significantly over the coming decades. Analyses from the national joint registry of England and Wales support this prediction with an increase in primary TKA of 117% and an increase in revision TKA of 332% being forecast by 2030. Bone loss presents a challenge in revision TKA so an understanding of the aetiology and principles behind this is essential for the surgeon undertaking revision. The purpose of this article is to review the causes of bone loss in revision TKA, discuss the mechanisms of each cause and discuss the possible treatment options. The Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute (AORI) classification and zonal classification of bone loss are commonly used in assessing bone loss in pre-operative planning and will be used in this review. The recent literature was searched to find advantages and limitations of each commonly used method to address bone loss at revision TKA. Studies with the highest number or patients and longest follow-up period were selected as significant. Search terms were: ""aetiology of bone loss"", ""revision total knee arthroplasty"", ""management of bone loss"". Methods for managing bone loss have traditionally been cement augmentation, impaction bone grafting, bulk structural bone graft and stemmed implants with metal augments. No single technique was found to be superior. Megaprostheses have a role as a salvage procedure when the bone loss is deemed to be too significant for reconstruction. Metaphyseal cones and sleeves are a newer treatments with promising medium to long term outcomes. Bone loss encountered at revision TKA presents a significant challenge. No single technique currently has clear superiority treatment should be based on a sound understanding of the underlying principles.","Jabbal Monu, Simpson A Hamish Rw, Walmsley Phil",Orthopedic reviews,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37405274/,
37404124,Are Patients With Morbid Obesity at Increased Risk of Pulmonary Embolism or Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis After Lower Limb Arthroplasty? A Large-database Study.,"Whether increased BMI is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is controversial. Despite this, BMI > 40 kg/m 2 remains a common cutoff for lower limb arthroplasty eligibility. Current United Kingdom national guidelines list obesity as a risk factor for VTE, but these are based on evidence that has largely failed to differentiate between potentially minor (distal deep vein thrombosis [DVT]), and more harmful (pulmonary embolism [PE] and proximal DVT) diagnoses. Determining the association between BMI and the risk of clinically important VTE is needed to improve the utility of national risk stratification tools. (1) In patients undergoing lower limb arthroplasty, is BMI 40 kg/m 2 or higher (morbid obesity) associated with an increased risk of PE or proximal DVT within 90 days of surgery, compared with patients with BMI less than 40 kg/m 2 ? (2) What proportion of investigations ordered for PE and proximal DVT were positive in patients with morbid obesity who underwent lower limb arthroplasty compared with those with BMI less than 40 kg/m 2 ? Data were collected retrospectively from the Northern Ireland Electronic Care Record, a national database recording patient demographics, diagnoses, encounters, and clinical correspondence. Between January 2016 and December 2020, 10,217 primary joint arthroplasties were performed. Of those, 21% (2184 joints) were excluded; 2183 were in patients with multiple arthroplasties and one had no recorded BMI. All 8033 remaining joints were eligible for inclusion, 52% of which (4184) were THAs, 44% (3494) were TKAs, and 4% (355) were unicompartmental knee arthroplasties; all patients had 90 days of follow-up. The Wells score was used to guide the investigations. Indications for CT pulmonary angiography for suspected PE included pleuritic chest pain, reduced oxygen saturations, dyspnea, or hemoptysis. Indications for ultrasound scans for suspected proximal DVT included leg swelling, pain, warmth, or erythema. Distal DVTs were recorded as negative scans because we do not treat them with modified anticoagulation. The division of categories was set at BMI 40 kg/m 2 , a common clinical cutoff used in surgical eligibility algorithms. Patients were grouped according to WHO BMI categories to assess for the following confounding variables: sex, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, joint replaced, VTE prophylaxis, grade of operative surgeon, and implant cement status. We found no increase in the odds of PE or proximal DVT in any WHO BMI category. When comparing patients with BMI less than 40 kg/m 2 with those with a BMI of 40 kg/m 2 or higher, there was no difference in the odds of PE (0.8% [58 of 7506] versus 0.8% [four of 527]; OR 1.0 [95% CI 0.4 to 2.8]; p > 0.99) or proximal DVT (0.4% [33 of 7506] versus 0.2% [one of 527]; OR 2.3 [95% CI 0.3 to 17.0]; p = 0.72). Of those who received diagnostic imaging, 21% (59 of 276) of CT pulmonary angiograms and 4% (34 of 718) of ultrasounds were positive for patients with BMI less than 40 kg/m 2 compared with 14% (four of 29; OR 1.6 [95% CI 0.6 to 4.5]; p = 0.47) and 2% (one of 57; OR 2.7 [95% CI 0.4 to 18.6]; p = 0.51) for patients with BMI 40 kg/m 2 or higher. There was no difference in the percentage of CT pulmonary angiograms ordered (4% [276 of 7506] versus 5% [29 of 527]; OR 0.7 [95% CI 0.5 to 1.0]; p = 0.07) or ultrasounds ordered (10% [718 of 7506] versus 11% [57 of 527]; OR 0.9 [95% CI 0.7 to 1.2]; p = 0.49) for BMI less than 40 kg/m 2 and BMI 40 kg/m 2 or higher. Increased BMI should not preclude individuals from lower limb arthroplasty based on suspected risk of clinically important VTE. National VTE risk stratification tools should be based on evidence assessing clinically relevant VTE (specifically, proximal DVT, PE, or death of thromboembolism) only.

This study aimed to determine the impact of the early appearance of radiolucent lines (linear images of 1, 2, or >2mm at the cement-bone interface) around the TKA on prosthetic survival and functional outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients during a 2-20 years follow-up. We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of RA patients treated with TKA between 2000 and 2011. We comparatively analyzed patients with and without radiolucent lines around implants. Clinical outcomes were assessed with the knee society score (KSS) collected before surgery, at years 2, 5, and 10, and at the last postoperative follow-up. The knee society roentgenographic evaluation system was used to analyze the impact of radiolucent lines around the implants at 1, 2, 5, and more than ten years of follow-up. The reoperation and prosthetic survival rates were calculated at the end of the follow-up. The study series included 72 TKAs with a median follow-up of 13.2 years (range: 4.0-21.0), of which 16 (22.2%) had radiolucent lines. We did not observe aseptic failure, and prosthetic survival at the end of the study was 94.4% (n=68). The KSS improved significantly (p<0.001) between preoperative values at 2, 5, and 10 years and the end of follow-up, with no differences between patients with and without radiolucent lines. Our study demonstrates that the early appearance of radiolucent lines around a TKA in RA patients does not significantly impact prosthetic survival or long-term functional outcomes at 13 years of follow-up.","Garabano G, Pesciallo C A, Rodriguez J, Perez Alamino L, Tillet F, Del Sel H, Lopreite F",Revista espanola de cirugia ortopedica y traumatologia,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37315920/,"Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatology, British Hospital of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

37295622,Association Between Surface Modifications for Biologic Fixation and Aseptic Loosening of Uncemented Total Knee Arthroplasties.,"Various surface modifications are used in uncemented total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) to enhance bony ingrowth and longevity of implants. This study aimed to identify which surface modifications are used, whether they are associated with different revision rates for aseptic loosening, and which are underperforming compared to cemented implants. Data on all cemented and uncemented TKAs used between 2007 and 2021 were obtained from the Dutch Arthroplasty Register. Uncemented TKAs were divided into groups based on their surface modifications. Revision rates for aseptic loosening and major revisions were compared between groups. Kaplan-Meier, Competing-Risk, Log-rank tests, and Cox regression analyses were used. In total, 235,500 cemented and 10,749 uncemented primary TKAs were included. The different uncemented TKA groups included the following: 1,140 porous-hydroxyapatite (HA); 8,450 Porous-uncoated; 702 Grit-blasted-uncoated; and 172 Grit-blasted-Titanium-nitride (TiN) implants. The 10-year revision rates for aseptic loosening and major revision of the cemented TKAs were 1.3 and 3.1%, and for uncemented TKAs 0.2 and 2.3% (porous-HA), 1.3 and 2.9% (porous-uncoated), 2.8 and 4.0% (grit-blasted-uncoated), and 7.9% and 17.4% (grit-blasted-TiN), respectively. Both type of revision rates varied significantly between the uncemented groups (log-rank tests, P < .001, P < .001). All grit-blasted implants had a significantly higher risk of aseptic loosening (P < .01), and porous-uncoated implants had a significantly lower risk of aseptic loosening than cemented implants (P = .03) after 10 years. There were 4 main uncemented surface modifications identified, with different revision rates for aseptic loosening. Implants with porous-HA and porous-uncoated had the best revision rates, at least equal to cemented TKAs. Grit-blasted implants with and without TiN underperformed, possibly due to the interaction of other factors.","Puijk Raymond, Rassir Rachid, Sierevelt Inger N, Spekenbrink-Spooren Anneke, Nelissen Rob G H H, Nolte Peter A",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Prosthesis Failure, Reoperation, Durapatite, Biological Products, Prosthesis Design, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37295622/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Spaarne Gasthuis, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Spaarne Gasthuis, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Xpert Clinics Orthopedie Amsterdam/Specialized Center of Orthopedic Research and Education, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Landelijke Registratie Orthopedische Interventies (LROI; Dutch Arthroplasty Register), Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands.; Department of Orthopaedics, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), Leiden, the Netherlands.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Spaarne Gasthuis, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands; Department of Oral Cell Biology, Academic Centre for Dentistry (ACTA), University of Amsterdam and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."

The aim of this systematic review was to determine implant survivorship, clinical outcomes and indications for revision in uncemented UKAs. A search strategy was employed using keywords related to UKAs and uncemented fixation to identify suitable studies. Both prospective and retrospective studies with a minimum of two year mean follow-up were included. Data was gathered on study design, implant type, patient demographics, survivorship, clinical outcome scores and the indications for revision. Methodological quality was assessed using a ten-point risk of bias scoring tool. Eighteen studies were included in the final review. The mean follow-up of studies ranged between 2-11 years. The primary outcome of survival demonstrated 5 year survivorship ranged between 91.7-100.0% and 10-year survivorship between 91.0-97.5%. Clinical and functional outcome scores were found to be excellent in the majority of studies with the remaining reporting good results. Revisions represented 2.7% of the total operations performed. There were 145 revisions with an overall revision rate of 0.8 per 100 observed component years. Osteoarthritis disease progression (30.2%) and bearing dislocations (23.8%) were the most common causes of implant failure.

37289912,Intraoperative Fractures Sustained During Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Critical Analysis Review.,"» While the occurrence of postoperative periprosthetic fractures around total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) are well reported, little is known about intraoperative fractures that occur during TKA. Intraoperative fractures during TKA can occur in femur, tibia, or patella. It is a rare complication with an incidence of 0.2% to 4.4%.» Risk factors of periprosthetic fractures include osteoporosis, anterior cortical notching, chronic corticosteroid use, advanced age, female sex, neurologic disorders, and surgical technique.» Fractures can potentially occur at any stage of the TKA including exposure, bone preparation, placement of trial components, cementation, insertion of the final components, and seating of the polyethylene insert. Forced flexion during trialing increases the risk for patella fracture, tibial plateau, or tubercle fractures especially when there is under resection of the bone.» Management guidelines for these fractures are lacking with current options being observation, internal fixation, the use of stems and augments, increasing constraint of the prosthesis, implant revision, and modifying the postoperative rehabilitation.» Finally, the outcomes of intraoperative fractures are not well reported in the literature.","Siddiqi Ahmed, Ahmed Afaaq, Pasqualini Ignacio, Molloy Robert M, Krebs Viktor E, Piuzzi Nicolas S",JBJS reviews,"Female, Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Femur, Fracture Fixation, Internal, Periprosthetic Fractures, Risk Factors",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37289912/,"Orthopedic Institute Brielle Orthopedics, a Division of Ortho NJ, Manasquan, New Jersey.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, Nutley, New Jersey.; Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine, Pikeville, Kentucky.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio."
37279850,Association of Acute Kidney Injury With Antibiotic Loaded Cement Used for Treatment of Periprosthetic Joint Infection.,"Antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC) is commonly used in the treatment of periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) to increase the local concentration of antibiotic at the site of infection. Use of ALBC has been associated with rare instances of acute kidney injury (AKI) despite low systemic absorption of the nephrotoxic antibiotics; however, the incidence of AKI is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for AKI associated with ALBC. This single-site, retrospective cohort study compared 162 PJI patients who underwent Stage 1 revision to a spacer with ALBC to 115 PJI patients who underwent debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) without the use of ALBC. Both groups received similar systemic antibiotics postoperatively. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regressions were used to analyze risk factors for AKI. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of AKI: 29 patients (17.9%) in the ALBC group and 17 (14.7%) in DAIR group developed AKI (odds ratio 1.43; 95% CI 0.70 to 2.93). There was a trend toward increased severity of AKI in the ALBC group. Chronic kidney disease, systemic vancomycin, and diuretic use were independent factors associated with the risk of AKI. An AKI occurred in 17% of PJI patients receiving either a spacer with ALBC or a DAIR. The use of ALBC was not associated with a significant increased risk of AKI. However, the use of systemic vancomycin and diuretic use were independent predictors of AKI in this patient population.","Savas Matthew J, Gray Kristine F, Blackburn Brenna E, Pelt Christopher E, Gililland Jeremy M, Certain Laura K",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Vancomycin, Bone Cements, Prosthesis-Related Infections, Retrospective Studies, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Acute Kidney Injury, Arthritis, Infectious, Diuretics, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37279850/,"College of Pharmacy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah."
37265991,Application strategy of finite element analysis in artificial knee arthroplasty.,"Artificial knee arthroplasty, as the most effective method for the treatment of end-stage joint diseases such as knee osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, is widely used in the field of joint surgery. At present, Finite element analysis (FEA) has been widely used in artificial knee replacement biomechanical research. This review presents the current hotspots for the application of FEA in the field of artificial knee replacement by reviewing the existing research literature and, by comparison, summarizes guidance and recommendations for artificial knee replacement surgery. We believe that lower contact stress can produce less wear and complications when components move against each other, in the process of total knee arthroplasty (TKA), mobile-bearing prostheses reduce the contact surface stress of the tibial-femoral joint compared with fixed-bearing prostheses, thus reducing the wear of the polyethylene insert. Compared with mechanical alignment, kinematic alignment reduces the maximum stress and maximum strain of the femoral component and polyethylene insert in TKA, and the lower stress reduces the wear of the joint contact surface and prolongs the life of the prosthesis. In the unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), the femoral and tibial components of mobile-bearing prostheses have better conformity, which can reduce the wear of the components, while local stress concentration caused by excessive overconformity of fixed-bearing prostheses should be avoided in UKA to prevent accelerated wear of the components, the mobile-bearing prosthesis maintained in the coronal position from 4° varus to 4° valgus and the fixed-bearing prosthesis implanted in the neutral position (0°) are recommended. In revision total knee arthroplasty (RTKA), the stem implant design should maintain the best balance between preserving bone and reducing stress around the prosthesis after implantation. Compared with cemented stems, cementless press-fit femoral stems show higher fretting, for tibial plateau bone defects, porous metal blocks are more effective in stress dispersion. Finally, compared with traditional mechanical research methods, FEA methods can yield relatively accurate simulations, which could compensate for the deficiencies of traditional mechanics in knee joint research. Thus, FEA has great potential for applications in the field of medicine.","Zhang Zi-Heng, Qi Yan-Song, Wei Bao-Gang, Bao Hu-Ri-Cha, Xu Yong-Sheng",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37265991/,"Orthopedics Center, Inner Mongolia People's Hospital, Hohhot, China.; Graduate School, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot, China."
37259548,High rate of radiolucent lines following the cemented original design of the ATTUNE total knee arthroplasty.,"Loosening of components after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can be associated with the development of radiolucent lines (RLLs). The aim of this study was to assess the rate of formation of RLLs in the cemented original design of the ATTUNE TKA and their relationship to loosening. A systematic search was undertaken using the Cochrane methodology in three online databases: MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. Studies were screened against predetermined criteria, and data were extracted. Available National Joint Registries in the Network of Orthopaedic Registries of Europe were also screened. A random effects model meta-analysis was undertaken. Of 263 studies, 12 were included with a total of 3,861 TKAs. Meta-analysis of ten studies showed high rates of overall tibial or femoral RLLs for the cemented original design of the ATTUNE TKA. The overall rate was 21.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 12.7% to 33.7%) for all types of design but was higher for certain subgroups: 27.4% (95% CI 13.4% to 47.9%) for the cruciate-retaining type, and 29.9% (95% CI 15.6% to 49.6%) for the fixed-bearing type. Meta-analysis of five studies comparing the ATTUNE TKA with other implants showed a significantly higher risk of overall tibial or femoral RLLs (odds ratio (OR) 2.841 (95% CI 1.219 to 6.623); p = 0.016) for the ATTUNE. The rates of loosening or revision for loosening were lower, at 1.2% and 0.9% respectively, but the rates varied from 0% to 16.3%. The registry data did not report specifically on the original ATTUNE TKA or on revision due to loosening, but 'all-cause' five-year revision rates for the cemented ATTUNE varied from 2.6% to 5.9%. The original cemented ATTUNE TKA has high rates of RLLs, but their clinical significance is uncertain given the overall low associated rates of loosening and revision. However, in view of the high rates of RLLs and the variation in the rates of loosening and revision between studies and registries, close surveillance of patients who have undergone TKA with the original ATTUNE system is recommended.","Prodromidis Apostolos D, Chloros George D, Thivaios Georgios C, Sutton Paul M, Pandit Hemant, Giannoudis Peter V, Charalambous Charalambos P",The bone & joint journal,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Femur, Tibia, Reoperation, Prosthesis Design, Prosthesis Failure, Knee Joint",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37259548/,"Academic Department of Trauma & Orthopaedics, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.; Department of Orthopaedics, Laiko General Hospital, Athens, Greece.; Department of Orthopaedics, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, UK.; Department of Orthopaedics, Chapel Allerton Hospital, Leeds, UK.; Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.; NIHR Leeds Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Unit, Leeds, UK.; Department of Orthopaedics, Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackpool, UK.; School of Medicine, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK."

Methods Ten years of retrospective reviews of 80 patients who had cementless, complete rotating platform TKR (DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, Indiana) were performed. Patients were divided into two groups according to their age (above and below 70 years old). Functional outcomes at the final follow-up were evaluated clinically by filling out a satisfaction form, and the Oxford Knee Score as well as all medical and surgical complications were recorded for each patient. Results The 10-year cumulative implant survival rate was 100%, i.e. no patients had revision surgeries with no significant statistical difference between the two age groups. The 10-year evaluation rate was 90%. Conclusion The use of cementless TKA exhibited good survivability, long-term clinical and functional results, and no implant revision in various age groups, as well as a high satisfaction rate. There was no statistically significant difference between the results of different age groups.","Abdallatif Ahmad G, Winkworth Corrina, Aslam Nadim",Cureus,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37252495/,"Trauma and Orthopaedics, Worcester Royal Hospital, Worcester, GBR.; Trauma and Orthopaedics, Worcester Royal Hospital, Worcestershire, GBR."
37210859,Patellofemoral arthroplasty conversion to total knee arthroplasty: An updated retrieval analysis and clinical outcomes.,"A prior retrieval analysis found high rates of infection after conversion of PFA to TKA, but was limited by a small sample size. The purpose of this study is to perform a retrieval analysis with clinical correlation on an expanded group of patients to better understand conversion of PFA to TKA. A retrospective review of an implant retrieval registry identified 62 conversions of PFA to TKA between 2004-2021. Implants were analyzed for wear pattern and cement fixation. Patient charts were reviewed for demographic information, perioperative data, prior and subsequent surgical procedures, complications and outcomes. Radiographs performed prior to index PFA and conversion procedures were assessed for KL grading. Cement fixation was present on 86% of retrieved components and wear was more pronounced on the lateral side. The most common indication for conversion to TKA was progression of OA in 46.8% of patients, followed by unexplained pain in the absence of radiographic or clinical changes (37.1%), loosening (8.1%), mechanical symptoms (4.8%), traumatic (3.2%). Thirteen patient experienced complications requiring additional procedures including arthrofibrosis (n = 4, 7.3%), PJI (n = 3, 5.5%), instability (n = 3, 5.5%), hematoma (n = 2, 3.6%) and loosening (n = 1, 1.8%). Revision components were used in 1.8% of cases and average post-conversion arc of motion was 119 degrees. The most common reason for PFA conversion to TKA was progression of osteoarthritis. PFA conversion to TKA is technically similar to primary TKA, but complication rates are more consistent with revision TKA in this study.","Anatone Alex J, Uppstrom Tyler J, Fletcher Connor, Baral Elexis, Gomoll Andreas H, Strickland Sabrina M",The Knee,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37210859/,"Hospital for Special Surgery, 535 E 70th Street, New York, NY 10021, USA.

37160445,Indications and techniques for non-articulating spacers in massive bone loss following prosthetic knee joint infection: a scoping review.,"Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a destructive complication of knee replacement surgery (KR). In two-stage revision a spacer is required to maintain limb length and alignment and provide a stable limb on which to mobilise. Spacers may be articulating or static with the gold standard spacer yet to be defined. The aims of this scoping review were to summarise the types of static spacer used to treat PJI after KR, their indications for use and early complication rates. We conducted a scoping review based on the Joanna Briggs Institute's ""JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis"" Scoping review reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched from 2005 to 2022 for studies on the use of static spacers for PJI after KR. 41 studies (1230 patients/knees) were identified describing 42 static spacer constructs. Twenty-three (23/42 [54.2%]) incorporated cement augmented with metalwork, while nineteen (19/42, [45.9%]) were made of cement alone. Spacers were most frequently anchored in the diaphysis (22/42, [53.3%]), particularly in the setting of extensive bone loss (mean AORI Type = F3/T3; 11/15 studies 78.3% diaphyseal anchoring). 7.1% (79 of 1117 knees) of static spacers had a complication requiring further surgery prior to planned second stage with the most common complication being infection (86.1%). This study has summarised the large variety in static spacer constructs used for staged revision KR for PJI.

However, it is not known whether these outcomes are maintained at long-term follow-up. This study aimed to evaluate long-term implant survivorship, modes of failure, and patient satisfaction following robotic-arm-assisted medial UKA. A prospective multicenter study of 474 consecutive patients (531 knees) undergoing robotic-arm-assisted medial UKA was conducted. A cemented, fixed-bearing system with a metal-backed onlay tibial implant was used in all cases. Patients were contacted at 10-year follow-up to determine implant survivorship and satisfaction. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier models. Data were analyzed for 366 patients (411 knees) with a mean follow-up of 10.2 ± 0.4 years. A total of 29 revisions were reported, corresponding to a 10-year survivorship of 91.7% (95% confidence interval, 88.8% to 94.6%). Of all revisions, 26 UKAs were revised to total knee arthroplasty. Unexplained pain and aseptic loosening were the most commonly reported modes of failure, accounting for 38% and 35% of revisions, respectively. Of patients without revision, 91% were either satisfied or very satisfied with their overall knee function. This prospective multicenter study found high 10-year survivorship and patient satisfaction following robotic-arm-assisted medial UKA. Pain and fixation failure remained common causes for revision following cemented fixed-bearing medial UKA, despite the use of a robotic-arm-assisted technique.

37142239,Clinical Outcomes of Offset Stem Couplers with or without Cone Augmentation in Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"Intramedullary stems are often required in patients undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) to achieve stable fixation. Significant bone loss may require the addition of a metal cone to maximize fixation and osteointegration. The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes in rTKA using different fixation techniques. We conducted a single-institution retrospective review of all patients who received a tibial and femoral stem during rTKA between August 2011 and July 2021. Patients were separated into three cohorts based on fixation construct: press-fit stem with an offset coupler (OS), fully cemented straight (CS) stem, and press-fit straight (PFS) stem. A subanalysis of patients who received tibial cone augmentation was also conducted. A total of 358 patients who underwent rTKA were included in this study, of which 102 (28.5%) had a minimum 2-year follow-up and 25 (7.0%) had a minimum 5-year follow-up. In the primary analysis, 194 patients were included in the OS cohort, 72 in the CS cohort, and 92 in the PFS cohort. When stem type alone was considered, there was no significant difference in rerevision rate (<i>p</i> = 0.431) between cohorts. Subanalysis of patients who received augmentation with a tibial cone demonstrated that OS implants led to significantly higher rates of rerevision compared with the other two stem types (OS: 18.2% vs. CS: 2.1% vs. PFS: 11.1%; <i>p</i> = 0.037). The findings of the present analysis demonstrate that CS and cones in rTKA may provide more reliable long-term outcomes compared with press-fit stems with OS.

37142071,"Patients Undergoing Primary, Cementless TKA had Similar Pain, Opioid Utilization, and Functional Outcomes Compared to Matched Patients With Cemented Fixation.","Despite renewed interest in cementless fixation of total knee implants, many surgeons have anecdotal concerns about slower recovery and higher early pain scores. We sought to analyze 90-day opioid utilizations, inhospital pain scores, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in patients undergoing primary cemented versus cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We retrospectively identified a cohort of opioid naïve patients undergoing primary TKA for osteoarthritis. There were 186 patients who had cementless TKAs matched 1:6 with 1,116 who received a cemented TKAs based on age (±6 years), body mass index (BMI) (±5), and sex. We compared inhospital pain scores, 90-day opioid utilizations in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs), and early postoperative PROMs. The cemented and cementless cohorts had similar lowest (0.09 versus 0.08), highest (7.36 versus 7.34), and average (3.26 versus 3.27) pain scores using numeric rating scale (P > .05). They received similar inhospital (90 versus 102, P = .176), discharge (315 versus 315, P = .483), and total (687 versus 720, P = .547) MMEs. They had similar average inpatient hourly opioid consumption (2.5 versus 2.5 MMEs/hour, P = .965). Average refills 90 days postoperatively were similar in both cohorts (1.5 versus 1.4 refills, P = .893). Also, preoperative, 6-week, 3-month, delta 6-week, and delta 3-month PROMs scores were similar between cemented and cementless cohorts (P > .05) CONCLUSION: This matched study demonstrated similar in-hospital pain scores and opioid utilization, total MMEs prescribed within 90 days, and PROMs at 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively between cemented and cementless TKAs.

37142069,The Practice Patterns of American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons for the Management of Chronic Periprosthetic Joint Infection After Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"The management of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has considerable variation. In order to better capture current preferences for the management of PJI, this study sought to poll the current members of American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) first to characterize the distribution of practice patterns. There were 32 questions in an online survey distributed to members of AAHKS. The questions were multiple choice regarding the management of PJI for TKA. There were 844 out of 2,752 members who completed the survey (response rate of 31%). Most of the members were in private practice (50%) compared to 28% being in an academic setting. On average, members were performing between 6 to 20 PJI cases per year. Two-stage exchange arthroplasty was performed in over 75% of the cases with either a cruciate retaining (CR) or posterior stabilized (PS) primary femoral component used in over 50% of the cases and 62% using an all-polyethylene tibial implant. Most of the members were using vancomycin and tobramycin. Typically, 2 to 3 grams of antibiotics were added per bag of cement regardless of the cement type. When indicated, amphotericin was the most often-used antifungal. Post-operative management had major variability with range of motion, brace use, and weight-bearing restrictions. There was variability in the responses from the members of AAHKS, but there was a preference toward performing a two-stage exchange arthroplasty with an articulating spacer using a metal femoral component and an all-polyethylene liner.","Duncan Stephen T, Schwarzkopf Ran, Seyler Thorsten M, Landy David C",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, United States, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Prosthesis-Related Infections, Knee Joint, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Surgeons, Polyethylene, Arthritis, Infectious, Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37142069/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, NYU, New York, New York.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina."
37140943,Did a New Design of the Oxford Unicompartmental Knee Prosthesis Result in Improved Survival? A Study From the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register 2012-2021.,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has generally shown higher revision rates than TKA, and this is particularly true for the femoral component. A twin-peg femoral component (Oxford Partial) has replaced the single-peg version (Oxford Phase III) of the widely used Oxford medial UKA, with the aim of improving femoral component fixation. The introduction of the Oxford Partial Knee also included a fully uncemented option. However, there has been relatively little evidence regarding the effect of these changes on implant survival and revision diagnoses from groups not associated with the implant design. Using data from the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register, we asked: (1) Has the 5-year implant survival (free from revision for any cause) improved with the medial Oxford unicompartmental knee after the introduction of new designs? (2) Did the causes of revision change between the old and new designs? (3) Is there a difference in risk for specific revision causes between the uncemented and cemented versions of the new design? We performed a registry-based observational study using data from the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register, a nationwide, mandatory and governmental registry with a high reporting rate. Between 2012 and 2021, 7549 Oxford UKAs were performed, and 105 were excluded due to combinations of the three designs, lateral compartment replacement, or hybrid fixation, leaving 908 cemented Oxford Phase III single-peg (used from 2012 to 2017), 4715 cemented Oxford Partial twin-peg (used from 2012 to 2021), and 1821 uncemented Oxford Partial twin-peg (used from 2014 to 2021), UKAs available for the analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression multivariate analysis were used to find the 5-year implant survival and the risk of revision (hazard ratio), when adjusting for age, gender, diagnosis, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, and time period. The risk of revision for any cause and the risk of revision for specific causes were compared, first for the older with the two new designs, and second for the cemented with the uncemented version of the new design. Revision was defined as any operation exchanging or removing implant parts. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier overall implant survival (free from revision for any cause) for the medial Oxford Partial unicompartmental knee did not improve over the study period. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival was different (p = 0.03) between the groups: it was 92% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90% to 94%) for the cemented Oxford III, 94% (95% CI 93% to 95%) for the cemented Oxford Partial, and 94% (95% CI 92% to 95%) for the uncemented Oxford Partial. However, the overall risk of revision during the first 5 years was not different between the groups (Cox regression HR 0.8 [95% CI 0.6 to 1.0]; p = 0.09 and 1.0 [95% CI 0.7 to 1.4]; p = 0.89 for the cemented Oxford Partial and the uncemented Oxford Partial, respectively, compared with cemented Oxford III [HR 1]). The uncemented Oxford Partial had a higher risk of revision for infection (HR 3.6 [95% CI 1.2 to 10.5]; p = 0.02) compared with the cemented Oxford III. The uncemented Oxford Partial had a lower risk of revision for pain (HR 0.5 [95% CI 0.2 to 1.0]; p = 0.045) and instability (HR 0.3 [95% CI 0.1 to 0.9]; p = 0.03) compared with the cemented Oxford III. The cemented Oxford Partial had a lower risk of revision for aseptic femoral loosening (HR 0.3 [95% CI 0.1 to 1.0]; p = 0.04) compared with the cemented Oxford III. When comparing the uncemented and cemented versions of the new design, the uncemented Oxford Partial had a higher risk of revision for periprosthetic fracture (HR 15 [95% CI 4 to 54]; p = 0.001) and infection within the first year (HR 3.0 [95% CI 1.5 to 5.7]; p = 0.001) than the cemented Oxford Partial. Considering that we found no difference in overall risk of revision during the first 5 years but we found a higher risk of revision for infection, periprosthetic fracture, and higher per implant cost, we currently would recommend against the use of uncemented Oxford Partial over the cemented Oxford Partial or the cemented Oxford III.

37133754,Radiolucent line assessment in cemented stemmed total knee (RISK) arthroplasty: validation of a modernized classification system.,"This study aims to implement and assess the inter- and intra-reliability of a modernized radiolucency assessment system; the Radiolucency In cemented Stemmed Knee (RISK) arthroplasty classification. Furthermore, we assessed the distribution of regions affected by radiolucency in patients undergoing stemmed cemented total knee arthroplasty. Stemmed total knee arthroplasty cases over 7-year period at a single institution were retrospectively identified and reviewed. The RISK classification system identifies five zones in the femur and five zones in the tibia in both the anteroposterior (AP) and lateral planes. Post-operative and follow-up radiographs were scored for radiolucency by four blinded reviewers at two distinct time points four weeks apart. Reliability was assessed using the kappa statistic. A heat map was generated to demonstrate the reported regions of radiolucency. 29 cases (63 radiographs) of stemmed total knee arthroplasty were examined radiographically using the RISK classification system. Intra-reliability (0.83) and Inter-reliability (0.80) scores were both consistent with a strong level of agreement using the kappa scoring system. Radiolucency was more commonly associated with the tibial component (76.6%) compared to the femoral component (23.3%), and the tibial anterior-posterior (AP) region 1 (medial plateau) was the most affected (14.9%). The RISK classification system is a reliable assessment tool for evaluating radiolucency around stemmed total knee arthroplasty using defined zones on both AP and lateral radiographs. Zones of radiolucency identified in this study may be relevant to implant survival and corresponded well with zones of fixation, which may help inform future research.","Francis Sam L, Murphy Benjamin P D S, Elsiwy Yassin, Babazadeh Sina, Clement Nicholas D, Stoney James D, Stevens Jarrad M",European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Retrospective Studies, Reproducibility of Results, Knee Prosthesis, Knee Joint, Tibia",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37133754/,"Department of Surgery, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Department of Orthopaedics, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Department of Orthopaedics, Monash Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma, University of Edinburgh, Little France, Edinburgh, EH16 4SA, UK.; Department of Surgery, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.

37127938,Selecting a high-dose antibiotic-laden cement knee spacer.,"Prosthetic joint infection [PJI] after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains a common and challenging problem for joint replacement surgeons and patients. Once the diagnosis of PJI has been made, patient goals and characteristics as well as the infection timeline dictate treatment. Most commonly, this involves a two-stage procedure with the removal of all implants, debridement, and placement of a static or dynamic antibiotic spacer. Static spacers are commonly indicated for older, less healthy patients that would benefit from soft tissue rest after initial debridement. Mobile spacers are typically used in younger, healthier patients to improve quality of life and reduce soft-tissue contractures during antibiotic spacer treatment. Spacers are highly customizable with regard to antibiotic choice, cement variety, and spacer design, each with reported advantages, drawbacks, and indications that will be covered in this article. While no spacer is superior to any other, the modern arthroplasty surgeon must be familiar with the available modalities to optimize treatment for each patient. Here we propose a treatment algorithm to assist surgeons in deciding on treatment for PJI after TKA.","Hollyer Ian, Ivanov David, Kappagoda Shanthi, Lowenberg David W, Goodman Stuart B, Amanatullah Derek F",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,"Humans, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Knee Joint, Knee Prosthesis, Prosthesis-Related Infections, Quality of Life, Reoperation, Retrospective Studies, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37127938/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Stanford University, Redwood City, California, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford Univeristy, Stanford, California, USA."
37100957,A decreased tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance is associated with lateral patellofemoral joint degeneration after implantation of medial fixed-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty - a minimum five year follow-up.,"The influence of lateral patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is controversial. Our aim was to identify radiographic factors that may lead to progressive PFOA after implantation of a fixed-bearing medial UKA and their impact on patient-reported outcomes (PROMs). A retrospective consecutive cohort of patients undergoing medial UKA with a minimum follow-up of 60 months between September 2011 and January 2017 was identified. All UKAs had a fixed-bearing design with cemented femoral and tibial components. PROMs included documentation of the Oxford Knee Score (OKS). The following radiographic parameters were evaluated on conventional radiographs and computer tomography (CT) scans: patella tilt angle, patella congruence angle, Caton-Deschamps index, medial and lateral patellofemoral degeneration (Kellgren-Lawrence Classification (KL)), mechanical anteroposterior axis, femoral torsion, tibial tuberosity to trochlear groove distance (TTTG), anteroposterior translation of the femoral component. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis and partial Pearson correlation analysis (SPSS) were used to evaluate for predictors of progression of lateral PFOA. Forty-nine knees allowed PFOA assessment and had an average follow-up of 62 months (range 60-108). Twenty-three patients did not exhibit any progression of lateral PFOA. Twenty-two progressed with 1 stage, whereas four had progressed 2 stages according to the KL classification. TTTG negatively correlated with progressive lateral PFOA (r =  - 0.436, p = 0.01). Progression of lateral PFOA did not correlate with OKS at last follow-up (p = 0.613). A decreased TTGT correlated with radiographic progression of lateral PFOA after medial fixed-bearing cemented UKA. PFOA however did not influence PROMs at a minimum of five years postoperatively.","Andronic Octavian, Helmy Näder, Kellner Christoph, Graf David Alexander",International orthopaedics,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Patellofemoral Joint, Follow-Up Studies, Knee Prosthesis, Retrospective Studies, Treatment Outcome, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Knee Joint, Bone Diseases",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37100957/,"Department of Traumatology and Orthopaedics, Bürgerspital Solothurn, Schöngrünstrasse, 42, Solothurn, Switzerland. and_octavian@gmx.ch.; Department of Traumatology and Orthopaedics, Bürgerspital Solothurn, Schöngrünstrasse, 42, Solothurn, Switzerland."
37051833,Incidence and severity of radiological lateral osteoarthritis 15 years following medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.,"To assess the incidence of radiological lateral osteoarthritis (OA) at 15 years after medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and assess the relationship of lateral OA with symptoms and patient characteristics. Cemented Phase 3 medial Oxford UKA implanted by two surgeons since 1998 for the recommended indications were prospectively followed. A 15-year cumulative revision rate for lateral OA of 5% for this series was previously reported. A total of 163 unrevised knees with 15-year (SD 1) anterior-posterior knee radiographs were studied. Lateral joint space width (JSW<sub>L</sub>) was measured and severity of lateral OA was classified as: nil/mild, moderate, and severe. Preoperative and 15-year Oxford Knee Scores (OKS) and American Knee Society Scores were determined. The effect of age, sex, BMI, and intraoperative findings was analyzed. Statistical analysis included one-way analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis H test, with significance set at 5%. The mean age was 80.6 years (SD 8.3), with 84 females and 79 males. The mean JSW<sub>L</sub> was 5.6 mm (SD 1.4), and was not significantly related to age, sex, or intraoperative findings. Those with BMI > 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> had a smaller JSW<sub>L</sub> than those with a 'normal' BMI (p = 0.039). The incidence of severe and moderate lateral OA were both 4.9%. Overall, 2/142 (1.4%) of those with nil/mild lateral OA, 1/8 (13%) with moderate, and 2/8 (25%) with severe subsequently had a revision. Those with severe (mean OKS 35.6 (SD 9.3)) and moderate OA (mean OKS 35.8 (SD 10.5)) tended to have worse outcome scores than those with nil/mild (mean OKS 39.5 (SD 9.2)) but the difference was only significant for OKS-Function (p = 0.044). This study showed that the rate of having severe or moderate radiological lateral OA at 15 years after medial UKA was low (both 4.9%). Although patients with severe or moderate lateral OA had a lower OKS than those with nil/mild OA, their mean scores (OKS 36) would be classified as good.","Searle Henry K C, Rahman Azmi, Desai Aditya P, Mellon Stephen J, Murray David W",Bone & joint open,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37051833/,"John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.; Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford, UK."
37042970,Description of surgical treatment methods of hip and knee periprosthetic joint infections in the Chinese mainland: a national multi-centre survey.,"Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a serious hip and knee arthroplasty complication. Despite the increased incidence of primary joint replacements, there is no clear guideline for treating PJI in the Chinese mainland yet. We aim to measure the current situation and basis for surgical treatment methods of PJI in major orthopaedic hospitals in the Chinese mainland. We conducted a national survey on PJI treatment in Mainland China. Forty-one top arthroplasty centers were included, with 82.9% (34/41) response rate. The data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel version 20.0 and described as numbers and percentages. For acute infections, prosthesis-preserving procedures (DAIR) are used in all centres. For hip and knee PJI, 20.5% (7/34) and 35% (12/34) of the centres used a one-stage exchange. If applied, this treatment will necessitate the previous patients' selection for a satisfactory outcome. All centres execute the two-stage exchange. Between phases, the majority of centres implant a cemented spacer. Revisions for infected hips included 21 (4.3%) cases of DAIR, 95 (19.9%) cases of single-stage exchange, 362 (75.2%) cases of two-stage exchange, and 2 (0.007%) cases of hip dissection. Revisions for infected knee comprised 88 (19.0%) cases of DAIR, 48 (10.3%) cases of single-stage exchange, 324 (69.8%) cases of two-stage exchange, and 5 (0.02%) cases of knee fusion. The centers do not have a uniform PJI standard. Most patients have two-stage revision with a cemented spacer in China. These concepts can help establish treatment guidelines.","Peng Huiming, Zhou Zongke, Xu Peng, Wang Fei, Zhu Qinsheng, Xia Yayi, Wang Jincheng, Yan Shigui, Cao Li, Weng Xisheng, Chinese Hip/Knee P. J.

This study evaluates clinical outcomes and survivorship of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using a current generation highly porous metal-backed patellar component. One-hundred twenty-five consecutive primary cementless TKAs with a compression molded highly porous metal-backed patella were reviewed. One-hundred three TKAs (82.4%) with 5-year clinical and radiographic follow-up were available for review. These were matched with 103 consecutive TKAs using a cemented patella of the same implant design. The cementless cohort had a mean age of 65.5 years, body mass index (BMI) of 33.0, and follow-up of 64.4 months. Indications for cementless TKA were based on multiple factors including age, BMI, and bone quality. There were no revisions for loosening or mechanical failure of the cementless patella compared with two cemented patellae revised for aseptic loosening. Eight patients required revisions in the cementless cohort: three for prosthetic joint infection (PJI), two for instability, one periprosthetic femur fracture, one for patella instability, and one for extensor mechanism rupture. Five patients required revisions in the cemented cohort: two for aseptic patellar loosening, one for aseptic femoral loosening, one for PJI, and one for instability. All-cause survivorship at 5 years was 92.2 and 95.1% for the cementless metal-backed implant and cemented implant cohorts, respectively. Use of a compression molded highly porous metal-backed patella component demonstrated excellent clinical and radiographic results at 5-year follow-up. Longer follow-up is required to evaluate the ability of highly porous cementless patella implants to provide durable long-term fixation.","Baker James F, Smith Nolan S, Likine Elive F, Smith Langan S, Yakkanti Madhusudhan R, Malkani Arthur L",The journal of knee surgery,"Humans, Aged, Patella, Knee Prosthesis, Follow-Up Studies, Porosity, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Metals, Reoperation, Prosthesis Design, Treatment Outcome, Prosthesis Failure",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37040872/,"ULP Orthopedics, UofL Health, Louisville, Kentucky.; University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky.; Louisville Orthopaedic Clinic, Louisville, Kentucky.; Adult Reconstruction Program, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky."
37027225,Tantalum Cementless Versus Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Meta-analysis of Level 1 Studies.,"Controversy exists on the ideal type of fixation in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Noncemented fixation has been theorized to improve patient outcomes and longevity of implantation without increased risk of aseptic loosening or radiolucent lines. We sought to compare (1) patient-reported outcomes, (2) survivorship, and (3) revision rates for all-cause and aseptic loosening in a noncemented tantalum total knee with its cemented counterpart. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines were searched using a combination of keywords ""trabecular metal,"" ""tantalum knee,"" ""total knee arthroplasty,"" and ""cementless trabecular."" Patient demographics such as age, sex, and body mass index were collected. Outcomes such as Knee Society Scores (KSSs), revisions, and radiolucent lines were recorded for analysis. Four randomized controlled trials involving 507 patients with an average 5-year follow-up were eligible for meta-analysis. No differences were observed in any demographics such as age, sex, body mass index, nor preoperative KSS. Patients in the cemented cohort improved from preoperative KSS 46.4 to postoperative KSS 90.4 while the tantalum cohort improved from 46.4 to 89.3. No statistical difference was observed in postoperative KSS mean difference between groups. Six patients from the tantalum group underwent revision with one patient for aseptic loosening. Twelve patients from the cemented group underwent revision with four patients for aseptic loosening. No statistical difference was observed between rates of revision, aseptic loosening, or radiolucent line development. Patient-reported outcomes improved postoperatively in both groups. No differences were detected between the cemented and noncemented TKAs in patient-reported outcomes, revision rates, or radiolucent line development. Noncemented tantalum fixation seems equivalent to cemented TKA survivorship. Longer term follow-up of these randomized controlled trials may provide a clearer understanding whether a difference exists.","Peddada Kranti V, Delman Connor M, Holland Christopher T, Meehan John P, Lum Zachary C",Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.

This study aims to analyze the minimum 2-year outcomes in patients who have a body mass index (BMI) > 35 undergoing cemented TKA using an all-polyethylene tibial component (APTC) at a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. We retrospectively studied 163 obese patients (192 TKAs) who underwent a primary cemented TKA using an APTC comparing the outcomes of 96 TKA patients who had a BMI > 35 to 39.9 (group A) with 96 patients who a TKA and a BMI ≥40 (group B). Median follow-up of groups A and B were 3.8 years and 3.5 years respectively (P = .02). Multiple regression analyses were performed to evaluate independent risk factors associated with complications. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were estimated, defining failure as the need for any further femoral or tibial revision surgery with implant removal, irrespective of the reason. There was no significant difference at the latest follow-up patient-reported outcomes between both groups. Survivorship, as defined by revision for any reason, was 99% for group A and 99% for group B (P = 1.00). There was 1 aseptic tibial failure in group A, and 1 septic failure in group B. Multiple regression analyses showed no significant associations between age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.00; P = .98; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93 to 1.08), sex (OR = 1.38; P = .70; 95% CI = 0.26 to 7.25), BMI (OR = 1.00; P = .95; 95% CI = 0.87 to 1.16), and complication rate.

A total of 152 patients underwent primary, unilateral TKA at two centers from 2014 to 2016. Only patients who had KL grade 3 (n = 69) or 4 (n = 83) osteoarthritis were included. There was no difference in age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, or preoperative Knee Society Score (KSS) between the groups. Patients who had KL grade 4 disease had a higher body mass index. KSS and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) were collected preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Generalized linear models were used to compare outcomes. Controlling for demographics, improvements in KSS were comparable between the groups at all time points. There was no difference in KSS, FJS, and the proportion that achieved the patient acceptable symptom state for FJS at 2 years. Patients who had KL grade 3 and 4 osteoarthritis experienced similar improvement at all time points up to 2 years after primary TKA. There is no justification for payers to deny access to surgical treatment for patients who have KL grade 3 osteoarthritis and have otherwise failed nonoperative treatment.","Goh Graham S, Schwartz Andrew M, Friend Jennifer K, Grace Trevor R, Wickes C Baylor, Bolognesi Michael P, Austin Matthew S",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Body Mass Index, Knee Joint, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37019313/,"Rothman Orthopaedic Institute at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.; Rothman Orthopaedic Institute at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
37003091,The effect of activity on the outcome of cementless mobile bearing unicompartmental knee replacements.,"Many surgeons consider high activity levels a contraindication to Unicompartmental Knee Replacement (UKR). Cementless fixation is of particular concern given the lack of cement to augment primary stability. We assessed the effect of pre and post-operative activity levels on the outcomes of cementless UKRs. A prospective cohort of 1000 medial cementless mobile bearing UKR were analysed. Patients were categorised by their pre-operative and highest post-operative Tegner Activity Score (TAS) and results compared between groups. Outcomes of interest included implant survival, Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and the American Knee Society Score - Objective/Functional (AKSS-O/F). Increasing post-operative activity were not associated with higher revision rates. The 10-year survival of the high activity group (TAS ≥ 5, 96.7% (CI 91.3-98.8), and low/medium activity group (TAS ≤ 4, 98.1% (CI 96.5-99.0)) were not significantly different (p = 0.57). The mean 10-year OKS of the high activity group (46.5, SD 3.1) was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that of the low/medium activity group (41.3, SD 7.7). There was a significant trend for increasing activity being associated with increasing AKSS-F at 5-years (p < 0.001) and 10 years (p = 0.01) and increasing AKSS-O at 5 years (p < 0.001). Higher pre-operative activity did not significantly increase revision rates and resulted in significantly higher 5-year post-operative scores. Neither higher pre-operative nor post-operative activity were associated with increased revision rates, but both were associated with better post-operative function. Therefore activity should not be considered a contraindication to cementless mobile bearing UKR and not be restricted post-operatively.","Mohammad Hasan Raza, Judge Andrew, Dodd Christopher, Murray David",The Knee,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Prospective Studies, Lysholm Knee Score, Reoperation, Treatment Outcome, Osteoarthritis, Knee",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37003091/,"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences University of Oxford, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford OX3 7LD, United Kingdom; Barts Bone & Joint Health, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary, University of London, London E1 2AD, United Kingdom.

37000268,Curve-on-curve technique does not improve tibial coverage in total knee arthroplasty in comparison to tibial tuberosity technique with use of anatomical implants: randomized controlled trial.,"During the last years, main attention while performing total knee replacement was paid to femoral component alignment; however, there is still lack of studies concerning tibial baseplate rotational alignment, especially in terms of anatomical designs of knee prosthesis. Some recent studies proved that tibial baseplate malrotation might be a cause of knee pain and patients' dissatisfaction. The aim of this study was to compare tibial component rotation and its coverage on the tibial plateau achieved with curve-on-curve and tibial tuberosity techniques (t-t technique) with use of anatomic knee designs with asymmetric tibial baseplate. A total of 88 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo total knee arthroplasty with use of the PERSONA PS (Zimmer Biomet) knee design with an asymmetric baseplate. The rotation of the tibial component was assessed and performed with two different techniques: curve-on-curve technique and tibial tuberosity technique. Tibial component rotation was measured on computed tomography (CT) scans using the method suggested by Benazzo et al. and designed for asymmetrical implants. For the measurement of the tibial bone coverage, the component surface area was outlined and measured on a proper CT section, then the tibial cut surface area was outlined and measured on a section just below the cement level. Pre- and post-operative range of motion was measured by another independent researcher 12 months post-operatively during follow-up visit. There was a statistically significant difference between both groups in median value of tibial rotation angle: 7° (interquartile range (IQR) = 0-12) in curve-on-curve technique group vs 2° (IQR-1-7) in tibial tuberosity technique group, probability value (p) = 0.0041, with values above 0 meaning external rotation of the component. There was no statistically significant difference between both groups in terms of range of motion (ROM) with average values of 124.3° ± 13.0° for curve-on-curve technique and 125.6° ± 12.8° for t-t technique with p = 0.45. There was a statistically insignificant difference between both groups in terms of coverage percentage in slight favor for curve-on-curve technique (85.9 ± 4.2 vs 84.5 ± 4.8, p = 0.17). In this study, no difference between the groups in terms of tibial bone coverage and range of motion was proved, even though both techniques differed significantly with values of tibial rotation. Future studies should be focused on influence of specific values of tibial rotation on patient-reported outcomes and survivorship of anatomic knee implants.","Maciąg Bartosz M, Kordyaczny Tomasz, Żarnovsky Krystian, Budzińska Martyna, Jegierski Dawid, Łapiński Marcin, Maciąg Grzegorz J, Stolarczyk Artur",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Joint, Tibia, Knee Prosthesis, Tomography, X-Ray Computed",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37000268/,"Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, Medical University of Warsaw, Międzyleski Specialist Hospital, 2 Bursztynowa St., 04-749, Warsaw, Poland. bmaciag@wum.edu.pl.; Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, Medical University of Warsaw, Międzyleski Specialist Hospital, 2 Bursztynowa St., 04-749, Warsaw, Poland."
36978024,Staged replacement of both hips and both knees in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) undergoing bilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are an uncommon population, and their outcomes are also difficult to predict. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether both bilateral cementless THA and cemented posterior-stabilized TKA (PS-TKA) can provide reliable outcomes for RA patients. We retrospectively reviewed 30 RA patients (60 hips and 60 knees) who underwent both elective bilateral cementless THA and cemented PS-TKA, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Clinical, patient-reported, and radiographic data were retrospectively analyzed. The mean follow-up was 84 months (range, 24-156). By the last follow-up, the post-operative range of motion, Harris Hip Score, Knee Society Score (KSS) clinical, KSS functional, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index of Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) hip, and WOMAC knee scores were significantly improved compared to the preoperative values. All patients achieved the ability to walk. In addition, overall satisfaction scores on a 100-point scale were 92.5 after THA and 89.6 after TKA. Only one patient underwent revision surgery due to knee joint instability, and all replaced hips and knees were radiographically stable by the assessment of the radiolucent line. The proportion of implants that did not suffer loosening or require revision surgery was 99.2% during the 84-month follow-up, based on Kaplan-Meier analysis. Our study suggests that bilateral cementless THA and cemented PS-TKA provides reliable mid-long-term clinical, patient-reported, and radiographic outcomes in RA patients, with high survivorship and patient satisfaction.","Cao Jian, Wang Wenqi, Feng Wei, Xu Hong, Wang Duan, Zhou Zongke",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,"Humans, Knee Prosthesis, Retrospective Studies, Treatment Outcome, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Joint, Arthritis, Rheumatoid, Joint Instability, Follow-Up Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36978024/,"Department of Orthopedics, Orthopedic Research Institute, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No.37, Guoxue Road, Wuhou District, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, People's Republic of China.; West China School of Medicine, Sichuan University, No.37, Guoxue Road, Wuhou District, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, People's Republic of China.; Department of Orthopedics, Orthopedic Research Institute, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No.37, Guoxue Road, Wuhou District, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, People's Republic of China. wangduan_bone@163.com.; Department of Orthopedics, Orthopedic Research Institute, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, No.37, Guoxue Road, Wuhou District, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, People's Republic of China. zhouzongke@scu.edu.cn."
36963531,Cementless and Cemented Dual-Pivot Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Matched Comparison With a Minimum Two-Year Follow-Up.,"With the use of newer biomaterials, many authors have reported similar results between cementless and cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of this study was to compare the early clinical and radiographic outcomes of cementless and cemented TKA using the same dual-pivot articulation. A consecutive series of 806 TKAs were implanted by a single surgeon using the same dual-pivot articulation. There were 634 TKAs (79%) cemented and 172 (21%) uncemented. One patient in the cementless group was lost before two years. The remaining 171 cementless TKAs were matched 1:1 with cemented TKAs with respect to age, sex, and body mass index. All patients were followed for a minimum of two years (range, 24-66 months) using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement , and Knee Society clinical and radiographic evaluation. The average follow-up was 3.8 years (range, 24-66 months) in the cemented group and 3.4 years (range, 24-56 months) in the cementless group. At final follow-up, the average Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement was higher in the cementless group (86 points (range, 64-100) versus 80 points (range, 57-100). Postoperative Knee Society scores (including pain and function) were similar. There was one deep infection (cemented TKA). The manipulation rate was 1.2% in the cementless group and 2.4% in the cemented TKA group. Excluding infection, two knees (1.2%) were revised in each group. No cases of femoral or tibial component loosening were identified. Patients implanted with either a cemented or cementless TKA using the same conforming dual-pivot articulation design had similar early outcomes and functional improvements. The type of fixation did not appear to influence the early clinical results.","Meding John B, Meding Lindsey K",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Follow-Up Studies, Bone Cements, Knee Joint, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Treatment Outcome, Prosthesis Failure",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36963531/,"The Center for Hip and Knee Surgery, Mooresville, Indiana."
36931364,John N. Insall Award: Randomized Clinical Trial of Cementless Versus Cemented Tibial Components: Durable and Reliable at a Mean 10-Years Follow-Up.,"Cementless fixation is gaining popularity for primary total knee arthroplasties (TKAs). The prior 5-year results of our randomized clinical trial that included 3 different tibial designs found minimal differences. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the 10-year results in the same cohort. Between 2003 and 2006, 389 primary TKAs were randomized: traditional modular cemented tibia (135); hybrid (cemented baseplate with uncemented pegs) monoblock tibia (128); and cementless monoblock tibia (126). Implant survivorships, radiographs, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Mean age at TKA was 68 years (range, 41 to 85), 46% were male, and mean body mass index was 32 (range, 21 to 59). The mean follow-up was 10 years. The 10-year survivorship free of any revision was similar between the hybrid monoblock and cementless monoblock groups at 96%, but lower (89%) for the traditional modular cemented tibia (P = .05). The traditional modular cemented tibia group had significantly more revisions for aseptic tibial loosening than the other 2 groups (7 versus 0%) at 10 years (P = .003). The traditional modular cemented tibia group had significantly more nonprogressive radiolucent lines than the hybrid and cementless monoblock groups (24, 12, and 9%, respectively). Clinical outcomes were similar and excellent between all 3 groups. Cementless and hybrid monoblock tibial components have excellent implant survivorship (96%) with no cases of aseptic tibial loosening to date. The traditional cemented modular tibial group had a 7% cumulative incidence of aseptic loosening at 10 years.

36882774,Does design change in total knee arthroplasty implants affect patient-reported outcomes?,"The purpose of this study is to compare the early results of patient-reported outcomes between two generations of a total knee system. Between June 2018 and April 2020, 121 first-generation, cemented TKAs (89 patients) and 123 s-generation, cemented TKAs (98 patients) were performed by a single surgeon. Demographic and surgical data were collected from all patients. Starting at the 6-month follow-up, patient-reported outcome measures Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Joint Reconstruction (KOOS-JR) and Knee Society (KS) clinical and radiographic scores were prospectively recorded. This study represents a retrospective review of these prospectively collected data. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographic variables such as age, body mass index, gender and race. KOOS-JR and Knee Society (KS) scores improved significantly (p < 0.001) from their preoperative values in both device generations. There were no differences, pre-operatively, between the two groups in terms of KOOS-JR, KS functional, KS objective, patient satisfaction, and expectation scores; however, there were statistically significant (p < 0.001) lower values of KOOS-JR and KS functional scores for first versus second generation at 6 months (81 vs. 89 and 69 vs. 74, respectively). While significant improvement in KS objective, subjective, and patient satisfaction scores were noted with both knee systems, KOOS-JR and KS function scores were significantly higher at the early (6-month) follow-up in the second-generation group. Patients responded acutely to the design change as evidenced by significantly improved patient-reported outcome scores for the second generation.","Toossi Nader, Bucklen Brandon, Meding Lindsey K, Meding John B",BMC surgery,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Joint, Body Mass Index, Knee Injuries, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Patient Reported Outcome Measures",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36882774/,"Musculoskeletal Education and Research Center (MERC) Audubon, 2560 General Armistead Ave, Audubon, PA, 19403, USA. ntoossi@globusmedical.com.; Musculoskeletal Education and Research Center (MERC) Audubon, 2560 General Armistead Ave, Audubon, PA, 19403, USA.; The Center for Hip and Knee Surgery, St. Francis Hospital Mooresville Mooresville, 46158, Mooresville, IN, USA."
36863574,Cementless Total Knee Arthroplasty is Associated With Early Aseptic Loosening in a Large National Database.,"Despite excellent longevity demonstrated in institutional studies, outcomes after cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) on a population level remain unknown. This study compares 2-year outcomes between cemented and cementless TKA using a large national database. A large national database was used to identify 294,485 patients undergoing primary TKA from January 2015 to December 2018. Patients who had osteoporosis or inflammatory arthritis were excluded. Cementless and cemented TKA patients were matched one-to-one based on age, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, sex, and year yielding matched cohorts of 10,580 patients. Outcomes at 90 days, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively were compared between groups, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate implant survival rates. At 1 year postoperatively, cementless TKA was associated with an increased rate of any reoperation (odds ratio [OR] 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.92, P = .005) compared to cemented TKA. At 2 years postoperatively, there was an increased risk of revision for aseptic loosening (OR 2.34, CI 1.47-3.85, P < .001) and any reoperation (OR 1.29, CI 1.04-1.59, P = .019) after cementless TKA. Two-year revision rates for infection, fracture, and patella resurfacing were similar between cohorts. In this large national database, cementless fixation is an independent risk factor for aseptic loosening requiring revision and any reoperation within 2 years after primary TKA.","Forlenza Enrico M, Serino Joseph, Terhune E Bailey, Weintraub Matthew T, Nam Denis, Della Valle Craig J",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Prosthesis Failure, Prosthesis Design, Bone Cements, Knee Prosthesis, Reoperation, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36863574/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois."
36862067,What is the Safe Distance Between Hip and Knee Implants to Reduce the Risk of Ipsilateral Metachronous Periprosthetic Joint Infection?,"Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), the most common cause of revision after TKA and THA, is a devastating complication for patients that is difficult to diagnose and treat. An increase in the number of patients with multiple joint arthroplasties in the same extremity will result in an increased risk of ipsilateral PJI. However, there is no definition of risk factors, micro-organism patterns, and safe distance between knee and hip implants for this patient group. (1) In patients with hip and knee arthroplasties on the same side who experience a PJI of one implant, are there factors associated with the development of subsequent PJI of the other implant? (2) In this patient group, how often is the same organism responsible for both PJIs? (3) Is a shorter distance from an infected prosthetic joint to an ipsilateral prosthetic joint associated with greater odds of subsequent infection of the second joint? We designed a retrospective study of a longitudinally maintained institutional database that identified all one-stage and two-stage procedures performed for chronic PJI of the hip and knee at our tertiary referral arthroplasty center between January 2010 and December 2018 (n = 2352). Of these patients, 6.8% (161 of 2352) had an ipsilateral hip or knee implant in situ at the time of receiving surgical treatment for a PJI of the hip or knee. The following criteria led to the exclusion of 39% (63 of 161) of these patients: 4.3% (seven of 161) for incomplete documentation, 30% (48 of 161) for unavailability of full-leg radiographs, and 5% (eight of 161) for synchronous infection. With regard to the latter, per internal protocol, all artificial joints were aspirated before septic surgery, allowing us to differentiate between synchronous and metachronous infection. The remaining 98 patients were included in the final analysis. Twenty patients experienced ipsilateral metachronous PJI during the study period (Group 1) and 78 patients did not experience a same-side PJI (Group 2). We analyzed the microbiological characteristics of bacteria during the first PJI and ipsilateral metachronous PJI. Calibrated, full-length plain radiographs were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic curves were analyzed to determine the optimal cutoff for the stem-to-stem and empty native bone distance. The mean time between the initial PJI and ipsilateral metachronous PJI was 8 ± 14 months. Patients were followed for a minimum of 24 months for any complications. The risk of ipsilateral metachronous PJI in the other joint secondary to a joint implant in which PJI develops can increase up to 20% in the first 2 years after the procedure. There was no difference between the two groups in age, sex, initial joint replacement (knee or hip), and BMI. However, patients in the ipsilateral metachronous PJI group were shorter and had a lower weight (1.6 ± 0.1 m and 76 ± 16 kg). An analysis of the microbiological characteristics of bacteria at the time of the initial PJI showed no differences in the proportions of difficult-to-treat, high virulence, and polymicrobial infections between the two groups (20% [20 of 98] versus 80% [78 of 98]). Our findings showed that the ipsilateral metachronous PJI group had a shorter stem-to-stem distance, shorter empty native bone distance, and a higher risk of cement restrictor failure (p < 0.01) than the 78 patients who did not experience ipsilateral metachronous PJI during the study period. An analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve showed a cutoff of 7 cm for the empty native bone distance (p < 0.01), with a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 75%. The risk of ipsilateral metachronous PJI in patients with multiple joint arthroplasties is associated with shorter stature and stem-to-stem distance. Appropriate position of the cement restrictor and native bone distance are important in reducing the risk of ipsilateral metachronous PJI in these patients. Future studies might evaluate the risk of ipsilateral metachronous PJI owing to bone adjacency.

36858127,Artificial Intelligence Radiographic Analysis Tool for Total Knee Arthroplasty.,"The postoperative follow-up of a patient after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) requires regular evaluation of the condition of the knee through interpretation of X-rays. This rigorous analysis requires expertize, time, and methodical standardization. Our work evaluated the use of an artificial intelligence tool, X-TKA, to assist surgeons in their interpretation. A series of 12 convolutional neural networks were trained on a large database containing 39,751 X-ray images. These algorithms are able to determine examination quality, identify image characteristics, assess prosthesis sizing and positioning, measure knee-prosthesis alignment angles, and detect anomalies in the bone-cement-implant complex. The individual interpretations of a pool of senior surgeons with and without the assistance of X-TKA were evaluated on a reference dataset built in consensus by senior surgeons. The algorithms obtained a mean area under the curve value of 0.98 on the quality assurance and the image characteristics tasks. They reached a mean difference for the predicted angles of 1.71° (standard deviation, 1.53°), similar to the surgeon average difference of 1.69° (standard deviation, 1.52°). The comparative analysis showed that the assistance of X-TKA allowed surgeons to gain 5% in accuracy and 12% in sensitivity in the detection of interface anomalies. Moreover, this study demonstrated a gain in repeatability for each single surgeon (Light's kappa +0.17), as well as a gain in the reproducibility between surgeons (Light's kappa +0.1). This study highlights the benefit of using an intelligent artificial tool for a standardized interpretation of postoperative knee X-rays and indicates the potential for its use in clinical practice.","Bonnin Michel, Müller-Fouarge Florian, Estienne Théo, Bekadar Samir, Pouchy Charlotte, Ait Si Selmi Tarik",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Artificial Intelligence, Reproducibility of Results, Knee Joint, Knee Prosthesis, Osteoarthritis, Knee",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36858127/,"Centre Orthopédique Santy, Lyon, France.; Deemea, Paris, France."

There were 369 consecutive primary cemented TKAs with 5 to 8 years of follow-up. A tourniquet was used during component cementation in patients who underwent surgery from January 3, 2006, to March 31, 2010. No tourniquet was used from August 14, 2009, to October 14, 2014. There were 192 patients in the tourniquet group (TQ) and 177 patients in the no tourniquet group (NQ). Patient demographics, reoperations, and complications were recorded. RLLs were identified on anteroposterior, lateral, and skyline x-rays at 1, 2, and 5 to 8 years postoperatively using the modern knee society radiographic evaluation system. Demographics, reoperations, complications, and RLLs were compared. Age, sex, and body mass index were similar between groups. Mean tourniquet time in TQ was 11 minutes (range, 8 to 25). The presence of RLLs differed between groups, with 65% of TQ knees having RLLs under any part of the prostheses versus 46% of NQ knees (P < .001). The progression of RLL >2 mm occurred in 26.0% of knees in TQ and 16.7% of knees in NQ (P = .028). There were 13 TKAs that underwent subsequent revision surgery. There was no statistically or clinically significant difference in revision rate between groups (7 revisions in TQ, 6 in NQ, P = .66). Less RLLs were identified in NQ versus TQ. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences in revision rates between the NQ and TQ groups at 5 to 8 years.","Xu Haijun, Chen Antonia F, Shoji Monica M, Fitz Wolfgang, Lange Jeffrey K",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Knee Prosthesis, Cementation, Knee Joint, Radiography, Reoperation, Treatment Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36858126/,"Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei, China.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."

Sixteen years before, he had undergone a primary cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A radiological study showed osteolysis and loosening of the femoral component. Intraoperatively, a medial femoral condyle fracture was found. A rotating-hinge revision TKA with cemented stems was implanted. Femoral component fracture is extremely rare. Surgeons should remain vigilant with younger and heavier patients with severe unexplained pain. Early revision TKA using cemented, stemmed, and more constrained implants is usually necessary. Full and stable metal-to-bone contact through perfect cuts and a careful cementing technique avoiding debonded areas are recommended to prevent this complication.","Pujol Oriol, Reverté Mercè, Pijoan Joan, Minguell Joan, Joshi-Jubert Nayana, Castellet Enric",JBJS case connector,"Male, Humans, Aged, 80 and over, Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee, Prosthesis Failure, Knee Joint, Knee Prosthesis, Femoral Fractures",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36812361/,"Knee Surgery Unit, Orthopedic Surgery Department, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."
36812351,"Similar Survivorship but Different Revision Reasons for Uncemented Mobile-Bearing and Cemented Fixed-Bearing Medial UKA: A Long-Term Population-Based Cohort Study of 2,015 Patients.","Long-term survivorship and accurate characterization of revision reasons in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) are limited by a lack of long-term data and standardized definitions of revision. The aim of this study was to identify survivorship, risk factors, and reasons for revision in a large cohort of medial UKAs with long-term follow-up (up to 20 years). Patient, implant, and revision details for 2,015 primary medial UKAs (mean follow-up, 8 years) were recorded following systematic clinical and radiographic review. Survivorship and risk of revision were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards. Reasons for revision were analyzed using competing-risk analysis. Implant survivorship at 15 years was 92% for cemented fixed-bearing (cemFB), 91% for uncemented mobile-bearing (uncemMB), and 80% for cemented mobile-bearing (cemMB) UKAs (p = 0.02). When compared with cemFB, the risk of revision was higher for cemMB implants (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 3.2; p = 0.03). At 15 years, cemented implants had a higher cumulative frequency of revision due to aseptic loosening (3% to 4%, versus 0.4% for uncemented; p < 0.01), cemMB implants had a higher cumulative frequency of revision due to osteoarthritis progression (9% versus 2% to 3% for cemFB/uncemMB; p < 0.05), and uncemMB implants had a higher cumulative frequency of revision due to bearing dislocation (4% versus 2% for cemMB; p = 0.02). Compared with the oldest patients (≥70 years), younger patients had a higher risk of revision (<60 years: HR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.0; 60 to 69 years: HR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.0 to 2.4; p < 0.05 for both). At 15 years, there was a higher cumulative frequency of revision for aseptic loosening in these younger groups (3.2% and 3.5% versus 2.7% for ≥70 years; p < 0.05). Implant design and patient age were risk factors for revision of medial UKA. The findings from this study suggest that surgeons should consider using cemFB or uncemMB designs because of their superior long-term implant survivorship compared with cemMB designs. Additionally, for younger patients (<70 years), uncemMB designs had a lower risk of aseptic loosening than cemFB designs at the expense of a risk of bearing dislocation. Prognostic Level III .

36801475,Significantly Worse Fixation of Cemented Patellar Components on Multiacquisition Variable-Resonance Image Combination Magnetic Resonance Imaging Compared to Femoral and Tibial Components: A Cause for Concern?,"The etiology of anterior knee pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remains unclear. Few studies have examined patellar fixation quality. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the patellar cement-bone interface after TKA on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to correlate the patella fixation grade with the incidence of anterior knee pain. We retrospectively reviewed 279 knees undergoing metal artifact reduction MRI for either anterior or generalized knee pain at least 6 months after cemented, posterior-stabilized TKA with patellar resurfacing with one implant manufacturer. MRI cement-bone interfaces and percent-integration of the patella, femur, and tibia were assessed by a fellowship-trained senior musculoskeletal radiologist. The grade and character of the patella interface were compared to the femur and tibia. Regression analyses were used to determine the association between patella integration with anterior knee pain. There were more patellar components with ≥75% zones of fibrous tissue (50%) compared to the femur (18%) or tibia (5%) (P < .001). There were a greater number of patellar implants with poor cement integration (18%) compared to the femur (1%) or tibia (1%) (P < .001). MRI findings showed more evidence of patellar component loosening (8%) compared to the femur (1%) or tibia (1%) (P < .001). Anterior knee pain was correlated with worse patella cement integration (P = .01), with women predicted to have better integration (P < .001). The quality of the patellar cement-bone interface after TKA is worse compared to the femoral or tibial component interface. Poor patellar cement-bone interface may be a source of anterior knee pain after TKA, but further investigation is required.","Debbi Eytan M, Mayman David J, Sapountzis Nicolas, Hawes Joseph, Cororaton Agnes D, Potter Hollis G, Haas Steven B, Chalmers Brian P",The Journal of arthroplasty,"Humans, Female, Patella, Tibia, Retrospective Studies, Knee Prosthesis, Femur, Knee Joint, Pain, Bone Cements",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36801475/,"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Adult Reconstruction and Joint Replacement, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York.; Biostatistics Core, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York.; Department of Radiology and Imaging, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York."
